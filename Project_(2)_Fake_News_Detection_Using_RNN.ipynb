privileges of traditional elites in a region scarred by widespread poverty some local groups have affiliated themselves with global franchises such as al qaeda and islamic state whose dwindling

and niger feel alienated and confused by the actions of those entities said alexander thurston an assistant professor at georgetown university who specializes in islam and politics in west africa the

inside the g5 headquarters general dacko told security council diplomats how he planned to take on the 1 000 or so terrorists he estimated operate in the area joint patrols hot pursuit operations and intelligence sharing among the five countries contributing to the force which should eventually boast nearly 5 000 soldiers will chase out drug traffickers and militants he said neither the u n mission in mali which cannot operate across borders nor the french taskforce which has concentrated on training local forces and going after high value targets has made securing the region s porous borders a priority last week the g5 deployed its first several hundred troops from mali niger and burkina faso to their shared borderlands where jihadists have carried out dozens of attacks this year the g5 is a source of hope and we believe in it completely dacko said initially skeptical of the force the united states pledged up to 60 million last week even so commitments from the g5 countries and donors stand at only a third of the estimated 490 million the force needs in its first year money logistical support and local opposition aside dacko said he was concerned about the relationship with the continent s biggest country algeria with which the g5 nations share a collective border roughly 2 500 km 1 500 miles long islamist militant groups emerged in algeria in the early 1990s and then spread beyond its borders the country s constitution prohibits foreign military intervention but analysts say its collaboration is essential because of its intelligence networks intimate knowledge of regional militants dacko however said there was no process as yet to formalize security cooperation between the g5 and the north africa country algerian officials were not immediately available to comment a source familiar with the algerian government s thinking said it already had channels of cooperation with g5 military officials and questioned the need for a new force you have minusma the u n peacekeeping mission in mali so why another regional group to fight terror in the sahel the source said algeria also sees the g5 as effectively being controlled by its former colonial master france with which it fought a bitter independence war and has since regarded with suspicion algeria perceives the g5 sahel as an extension of french influence in a region in which algeria has traditionally been dominant and in which france has historically played an essentially destabilizing role hannah armstrong an algeria expert at the international crisis group said algeria mediated talks leading to the 2015 peace deal in mali but it is sometimes suspected of not doing all it could to prevent militants using its desert spaces as a rear base it is essential to find ways to partner with algeria said soumeylou boubeye maiga mali s former intelligence chief as long as there is not a shared evaluation you cannot imagine a common course of action west africa s sahel initiative

              " 'on the inside ex goldman sachs partner tapped for us treasury joined by rothschild linked commerce secretary pickshawn helton 21st century wirepresident elect donald trump continues to fill key positions in the white house and in the process there have already been some controversial cabinet selections this week the trump transition team named former goldman sachs partner and ex soros fund management employee turned hollywood financier steve mnuchin as the us treasury secretary the mnuchin pick arrives simultaneously as long time billionaire pal of trump wilbur ross former head of rothschild inc s bankruptcy advisory business becomes commerce secretary while trump s cabinet nominees for the white house have not yet been set in stone the two selections mentioned above represent the type of financial syndicate we ve seen in the washington swamp for many years too big to fail photo illustration shawn helton of 21wire the financial crisis goldman sachs in april of 2016 mnuchin was tasked with being the finance chairman of trump s 2016 presidential campaign paving the way for another wall street insider to head to the white house in early november sources close to cnbc floated the idea that formerly scandal plagued jp morgan chase ceo jamie dimon was also up for consideration for us treasury secretary before mnuchin a long time acquaintance of trump was officially named the mnuchin selection appears at odds with trump s anti wall street campaign rhetoric as well as his drain the swamp mantra echoed towards the tail end of his presidential run in fact the optics of mnuchin s appointment seems to strike at the heart of the sub prime mortgage backed security lending which led to the 2007 2008 banking crisis during the economic crash extremely high risk subprime mortgage backed securities were crafted from bundled loans a large amount of these types of mortgages were adjustable rate mortgages where interests rates would be fixed for a certain number of years eventually sky rocketing to astronomical increases subsequently putting the burrower under water as the banks continued to sell these loans to investors this was a critical aspect that led directly to the foreclosure crisis that swept across the nation in the aftermath of 2008 according to an article featured in the money section of the website of how stuff works we are reminded of the devastating effects of the 2007 2008 crash in just the month of august 2008 one out of every 416 households in the united states had a new foreclosure filed against it source realtytrac when borrowers stopped making payments on their mortgages mbss mortgage backed security began to perform poorly the average collateralized debt obligation cdo lost about half of its value between 2006 and 2008 source this american life and since the riskiest and highest returning cdos were comprised of subprime mortgages they became worthless after the nationwide increase in loan defaults began continuing the article outlines how the hedge fund wall street casino made a fortune by packaging mortgages into bonds to sell to investors after mbss hit the financial markets they were reshaped into a wide variety of financial instruments with different amounts of risk interest only derivatives divided the interest payments made on a mortgage among investors if interest rates rise the return is good if rates fall and homeowners refinance then the security loses value in a bold and controversial move the president elect s administration by way of mnuchin is looking to derail the dodd frank act which was put in place in 2010 as a moderate buffer if at all to restrict the type of bank lending that led to the most recent financial crash in 2008 however naysayers of the protective act say it s much to soft on wall street which is in need of tougher restrictions as any new deregulation could be seen as an attempt to increase the coffers of larger investment banks in the passage below the new american expands on this idea through revelations released by the ny times according to the text of the 2010 dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the law is supposed to promote the financial stability of the united states by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system to end too big to fail and to protect the american taxpayer by ending bailouts however as is usually the case with federal laws dodd frank does precisely the opposite in fact reports the new york times gretchen morgenson dodd frank actually widened the federal safety net for big institutions under that law eight more giants were granted the right to tap the federal reserve for funding when the next crisis hits at the same time those eight may avoid dodd frank measures that govern how we re supposed to wind down institutions that get into trouble money man ex partner of goldman sachs steve mnuchin nominated to head the us treasury image source mgtvwten files wordpress com although mnuchin has cited that there s a need to restructure the dodd frank act because it would bring economic growth to regional banks and potentially open lending up to smaller businesses there is still a fear that this may be a revolving door for the central banks to profit from as well zerohedge provides additional background details regarding munchin s career in banking some more on mnuchin s background starting his career in the early 1980s as a trainee at salomon brothers before moving to goldman sachs in 1985 mnuchin was front and center for the advent of instruments like collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps he has called securitization an extremely positive development in terms of being able to finance different parts of the economy and different businesses efficiently the pitfalls of the financing method came later he s said mnuchin s father robert mnuchin was a partner at goldman sachs in the 1960s the second youngest of five siblings steven attended the prestigious riverdale country school and then yale university where his roommate was edward lampert who would go on to become a hedge fund manager and owner of sears in addition to goldman mnuchin also worked at soros fund management whose founder george soros has funded many left leaning causes where it gets even more bizarre is that mnuchin has donated frequently to democrats including to clinton and barack obama as a hedge fund manager mnuchin is part of a group of business people trump has excoriated in august trump said hedge fund managers were getting away with murder as he touted his proposal to end the so called carried interest loophole which gives private equity and hedge fund managers preferential tax treatment the hedge fund guys didn t build this country trump said at the time on cbs face the nation these are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky he said they are energetic they are very smart but a lot of them they are paper pushers they make a fortune they pay no tax it s ridiculous trump s disdain for wall street during his campaign run won t soon be forgotten by his supporters as the president elect s antithetical banking rhetoric will only be magnified by bringing mnuchin along with his banking and hedge fund past into the fold mnuchin s confirmation could be a contentious affair if only for show due to money made after his purchase of california s indymac following the financial crisis bloomberg recently stated the following concerning mnuchin s role in the aftermath of the banking and housing meltdown in 2009 during the depths of the financial crisis mnuchin joined with a group of former goldman sachs colleagues and billionaires to buy the remnants of indymac which had collapsed after bingeing on reckless home loans during the frenzy of california s subprime mortgage boom they changed the name to onewest turned it around and sold the bank for a big gain last year continuing bloomberg outlines how mnuchin may have seized on a financial opportunity but stops short of condemning the us treasury nominee it s unclear whether onewest s practices were worse than those of other banks during the financial crisis or how much blame mnuchin deserves for problems at a financial institution that was troubled before he bought it mnuchin declined to comment through a spokesman but former onewest vice chairman david fawer said in a statement that the bank inherited loans from indymac with extraordinarily high delinquency rates and worked tirelessly to modify thousands of loans to help homeowners through the financial crisis the bank has pointed to positive reviews of its foreclosure and loan modification practices by the obama treasury department the federal deposit insurance corp and the office of the comptroller of the currency interestingly the nation reported that mnuchin purchased the failing indymac with an agreement to be reimbursed for costs associated to foreclosures that were financed by the company the mnuchin group paid fdic 1 5 billion for the bank far less than the value of indymac s assets the fdic was so desperate to unload indymac that mnuchin and his colleagues were able to obtain as part of the purchase deal a so called shared loss agreement from the fdic which reimbursed these billionaires for much of their costs for foreclosing on people unlucky enough to have mortgages from indymac within a year the group that the los angeles times called a billionaires club of private financiers had paid themselves dividends of 1 57 billion in other words the fdic took much of the risk by subsidizing the bank s troubled assets while mnuchin and his colleagues pocketed the profits prior to considering mnuchin trump was said to have considered former ceo of bb t john allison an apparently harsh critic of the federal reserve banking system the following was reported by business insider on november 28th trump will meet with john allison the former ceo of the bank bb t and of the libertarian think tank the cato institute there have been reports that allison is being considered for treasury secretary trump s has on the campaign trail questioned the future of the

behaviour will be under watch the same will hold true for the newly tapped commerce secretary position to be filled by billionaire investor wilbur ross a brief rundown of some of the more controversial aspects of ross s past were recently published at forbes after an getting an mba from harvard he spent two decades heading rothschild inc s bankruptcy advisory business where he represented investors in trump s failing taj mahal casino in the early 1990s ross and carl icahn convinced bondholders to strike a deal with trump who some investors wanted to push out which allowed trump to retain control of the property continuing the article described how ross invested in distressed coal companies in addition to banking opportunities during the recession ross targeted another struggling industry banking he invested in troubled banks in england greece and cyprus he was also part of a group of investors that acquired a 35 stake in the bank of ireland during the height of europe s 2011 debt crisis he sold the last of his stake in 2014 nearly tripling his initial investment ross has also reportedly bet hundreds of millions of dollars on downtrodden oil and gas firms since the price of oil began to slide more than two years ago incidentally ross has maintained a tough public position on so called free trade deals like nafta and the soon to be defunct trans pacific partnership tpp but real questions still remain about his financial acquisitions during distressed times is he a risk taking business visionary or a financial vulture ross has denied being a business liquidator for profit and states that he has worked to rebuild failing businesses whatever the case may be mnuchin and ross have touted big corporate tax relief and large tax cuts to the middle class in the us however the public should be wary of their dealings with those on wall street and any new reform legislation aimed at deregulation banking deregulation and reform directed by wall street or one of their ilk should be treated with great suspicion if history is any lesson below is another look at a passage from a report i complied prior to the election entitled partners in crime goldman sachs the clintons wall street in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely the clinton goldman sachs wall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glass steagall act which banking luminaries cynically named the financial services modernization act of 1999 officially titled the gramm leach bliley act the original glass steagall was a depression age four part provision under the bank act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression 1929 1941 in fact the gramm leach bliley act which repealed glass steagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked simply put clinton s repeal of glass steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite which ultimately caused the global economy to crash in 2008 all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really in a cross posted article featured at huffington post nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the clinton administration during the 1990 s to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the clinton years of the 1990s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband s years in office prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in 2007 2008 prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled it takes a pillage behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glass steagall act since departing from the investment banking world the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the citi travelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administration s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glass steagall then in 1998 in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two year review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glass steagall would be repealed citigroup s co chairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther in 1999 after 12 attempts in 25 years congress passed the financial services modernization act which led to the repeal of glass steagall both of trump s finance picks arrive with the all to familiar baggage witnessed within the beltway swamp and if mnuchin s and ross s questionable pasts are to be accepted wholesale it s difficult to imagine insiders of their pedigree turning over a new leaf for the everyday man the following is a screen shot of a statement released by former goldman ceo and former treasury secretary hank paulson regarding the mnuchin pick as a reminder paulson

9 11 memorial service in new york city this past sunday she was promptly removed from the event by her campaign staff but video footage later emerged showing clinton being carried into her custom transport van now the media is buzzing with the question is hillary clinton fit enough for the oval office more importantly can she stay on the campaign trail as expected the clinton campaign is vehemently downplaying any health concerns insisting that the former secretary of state is absolutely fine the following is a video mix of this bizarre campaign scene where mrs clinton is lifted by multiple staffers and security into her van and also notice at the 48 second mark where a small item drops from her right pant leg onto the pavement below watch what would happen if she bowed out who would replace her is this a real possibility or is this simply the latest in a long line of sensational rightwing media reports designed to further distract and divert the american public away from important key issues facing america here is former huffington post journalist david seaman who was recently fired and his work censored and scrubbed from the internet by the huff post for reporting on clinton s health issues watch as he reveals wikileaks clinton email archive which reveal additional information clinton s health problems probing further into the possibility of hillary clinton actually dropping from the us presidential race is award winning health journalist and media analyst jon rappoport jon rappoport no more fake newsi ve written about her health problems before including the blood thinning coumadin she s taking and the blood clots and the advisory against flying because new life threatening blood clots can occur i wrote and i still say democrat power players would go along with electing her even if she was dragged into the oval office dead on arrival they don t care after hillary s fainting spell at the 9 11 memorial the washington post that organ of unquestioned truth grants that it s now acceptable to ask polite questions about her health well done boys you re really going out on a limb thanks so much i think it s time for major media to take an overt stand about hillary she may be very sick dangerously so but it s still a crime to emphasize that because it s sexist and besides untoward publicity could allow trump to slip into the white house and besides our news organization has donated to the clinton foundation and besides she s hillary and we all know and love her and we don t want to think about something bad happening to her because then we would cry i would accept that statement hillary s public coughing fits the physical instability the fainting the handler todd madison walking out on stage putting his hand on her telling her to keep talking as if she s forgotten what s going on you have to conclude her doctors have tried everything they can to keep her upright and functioning and if this is best they can do she s in bad shape hillary dropping out of the race for the oval office is no longer a fantasy it could happen if it does the media will swing into gear and try to demand a delay in the election there is no basis for such a demand because both major parties can pick their candidate on their own terms the democrats for example as we ve seen can rig the vote and secretly back hillary from the beginning and cook up propaganda to defeat bernie sanders they can choose a slew of so called super delegates who owe nothing to the voters and instead support whoever they want to hillary so if she drops out the democrat leaders can simply decide again without consulting voters who the substitute is kaine biden sanders elizabeth warren michelle obama rachel maddow karl marx no doubt some progressive pundit will suggest obama should stay in office for a while because he has the experience he s presidential he s done such a magnificent job in his two terms his mission is unfinished he must get the tpp treaty ratified we need him to continue the dialogue on race in the post racial society he knows how to bypass congress with a blizzard of executive orders he can figure out a way to admit millions more illegal immigrants to these shores he backs black lives matter and he knows how to talk about fake employment numbers and pretend they re real the democrats and their supporters will go on a victim binge woe is us hillary our leader has fallen we re crippled differently abled we need time to regroup we can t be expected to make a snap judgment who cares about constitutional rules governing elections this is really serious we have to decide what s best for the people and we have to find a way to pay off bernie sanders so he stays in hiding and keeps his big mouth shut i for one would like to see trump vs bernie socialist vs capitalist they could do three debates on globalism and its horrendous effects on america at which point the public would realize they both claim to perceive the gargantuan threat albeit from different angles hillary was the unabashed queen bee of globalism at any rate you can bet that as we speak media giants are taking private briefings on how the election season would proceed if she drops out they re preparing their talking points and tall stories and outright lies all somehow culminating in a democrat party victory this november come hell or high water after congressional leaders begged president obama to stay on for several months he reluctantly agreed saying well i do have sixty or seventy executive orders drawn up and ready to go so

people who raised you and loved you and kissed your boo boos when you got hurt unfortunately sometimes it is necessary as aubrey perry an australian based artist and author recently discovered in an article written for the sydney morning herald the young woman explained why she had to cut her parents out of her life and the life of her child perry was perusing a list of california trump delegates when she discovered a horrifying name on the list her mother s i found her name when i was scanning the list to see if the white supremacist william daniel johnson had been removed since he d said he would not be attending there she was 10 on the list she said her parents have always been racist her mother an esl english second language teacher and basic english teacher at the college level often referred to her students with contempt when perry was growing up she said greaseball wetback spic beaner i grew up with these words in the house not because that s what people called us that s what we called mexicans perry explains that she knew her parents believed ignorant garbage but because she lives in australia and only speaks to her parents online through text and on the phone it was easy to ignore they never spoke about politics however after perry saw her mom s name on the delegate list she started investigating and what she found is what ultimately led to her decision to severe ties and i don t use twitter much but wow my mum does i recently checked her twitter page for the first time in a while and was shocked hateful memes ugly language and appearance based attacks targeted at hillary clinton stacked up and not just hateful but off topic and malicious calling hillary ugly old and screechy an unlikeable old bag the woman card stinks my mother wrote my mother a college instructor she should know better she s no internet troll is she she was her mom was a trump troll and filled all of her social media accounts with racist sexist xenophobic memes and posts she found videos of her mom being interviewed by fox news at a california rally perry said the video shows her mom saying he sounds like us he talks like us i m all trump only trump always trump forever trump the video reminded her of the imperial wizard of the kkk saying that the klan supports trump because what he believes in we believe in perry isn t just an ordinary liberal who is disgusted with donald trump just because she is a progressive and he is a conservative his beliefs hurt her family my husband is black we have a daughter together my parents support of a candidate who could not decide if he should accept the endorsement of the kkk is completely intolerable in our home and ultimately in our world she finally confronted her mother and her mom brushed her off so she decided to take screenshots of her mom s hate speech saved the video clips of her interview on fox news and posted everything on facebook slamming her parents for their ignorance on twitter she said your twitter feed makes me disappointed and embarrassed of you as a person a supposed critical thinker and my mother shocked her mom responded by blocking her on social media her dad found out and sent her a threatening email saying i know you have never said anything you might not like to be made public he wrote so if you want to continue this attack mode please remember all things have consequences perry said her parents response to her criticism hurt her but she wasn t surprised more importantly though she said it was time to speak up and let them know that their hate and ignorance was not acceptable her entire life she had kept her mouth shut and let their rhetoric roll off her back and that she explains is her biggest regret by ignoring racism xenophobia and misogyny within our families we are accepting it within our culture to ignore is to accept as my daughter plays on the floor in front of me while i type this i think about her ancestry i think about the suffering that has been endured so that she can live in a free and just world and i feel a responsibility to the continuity of that humanity if i don t oppose my parents behaviour and objectives if i don t reject trump and all that he stands for if i don t change my family s vocabulary so that my daughter never knows the hateful words i heard growing up i m undoing the progress that generations before me have fought and died for and that i won t accept she s exactly right as a white woman with a mixed race child and a husband who is from central america i know where she is coming from for a very long time i ignored the hate coming not from my parents but from other people who i was close to people i d grown up with gone to school with it was easier to pretend they were not that stupid than to confront them and get into an argument like perry i came to the realization that by not telling these people how i felt how their hate affected my son my husband our friendship i was doing a disservice i started speaking out i m not friends with some of those people anymore and that s okay they are not nice people anyway the point is that by not speaking out we lead these people to believe that what

s election as u s president including rapidly confirming a new health secretary who could recast regulations while waiting for lawmakers to pass sweeping repeal legislation trump s victory on tuesday means republicans will control the white house senate and house of representatives but congressional democrats are expected to put up a huge fight against republican efforts to repeal the 2010 law considered president barack obama s signature domestic policy achievement the affordable care act dubbed obamacare has provided 25 million previously uninsured americans with health coverage republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law which they call a government overreach wyoming senator john barrasso a member of senate republican leadership said one way for the incoming president and congress to attack obamacare immediately after trump takes office on jan 20 would be to quickly confirm a new secretary of health and human services the official who writes the rules and regulations that enforce the law we could confirm someone on jan 20 who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations to give more freedom and choice to the states to insurance companies and to businesses that are trying to provide affordable care to their workers barrasso said in a telephone interview barrasso noted that the senate needs only a simple majority vote in the 100 seat chamber to confirm cabinet members as opposed to 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles the democrats could present to repeal legislation passing repeal legislation is not a day one activity but a new secretary of hhs going after the regulations can be a day one activity barrasso added trump during the campaign called obamacare a disaster and joined fellow republicans in vowing to repeal and replace it with proposals like tax free health savings accounts his transition website says trump wants a solution that returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states in repealing obamacare congressional republican may have to resort to a special procedure known as reconciliation to get around democrats in the senate where rules protect the rights of the minority party republicans in congress used reconciliation to try to undo large chunks of obamacare in january but obama vetoed the legislation the bill would have wiped out tax subsidies provided to help people afford insurance coverage as well as tax penalties on people who do not obtain insurance as required by the law and would have eliminated expansion of the medicaid insurance health insurance program republican representative chris collins of new york one of trump s earliest supporters on capitol hill said he hopes congress can pass a similar bill gutting obamacare within trump s first 100 days in office a promise trump made during the presidential campaign but some changes will doubtless be phased in over time collins said there s nothing that we will be able to do or would want to do that would impact anyone s health insurance plan for 2017 collins said in an interview from a replacement standpoint our position has always been as republicans to move forward in a step by step fashion barrasso said in an interview with the wall street journal published on friday trump said he was considering retaining parts of obamacare including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre existing medical conditions while waiting for congress to act on legislation the new hhs secretary could be reworking obamacare regulations barrasso said for example regulations could give u s states more flexibility under a provision that lets states seek waivers from key provisions of the law such as exemptions from the so called individual mandate requiring americans to obtain insurance and the employer mandate to provide it kim monk an analyst at capital alpha partners which provides policy research to financial institutions said trump s hhs might be able to tighten up the rules governing special enrollment periods for obamacare insurers complain that these periods have allowed some people who initially skipped buying insurance to sign up after becoming ill hhs might also be able to alter the language on essential benefits that the law requires insurance plans to cover which include trips to the emergency room maternity and newborn care and mental health services monk said the law requires they have to cover 10 essential health benefit categories but how that gets defined a lot of that is interpretative monk said and of course everything the obama administration interpreted was more more more more expensive coverage and all these things lead to premium increases collins a member of the trump transition team s executive committee said the job of hhs secretary or surgeon general would be great for ben carson referring to the neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the republican presidential nomination and later endorsed trump',\n",

              " 'hillary s secret weapon evan mcmullin is cia goldman sachs candidate backed by mitt romney s wall street machinej r smith 21st century wiremuch has been made by democrat hillary clinton and the white house s accusation that russia is trying to influence us elections although neither has presented any real evidence to back up this extraordinary claim on the other hand there is plenty of evidence documenting the cia interfering and altering numerous foreign elections throughout history this raises an interesting question would the cia ever try to interfere in an us election evan mcmullin is a 40 year old self described conservative mormon and former cia operative i enjoyed being a grey man said mcmullin of his 11 years in the cia on the wall in his salt lake city campaign offices is a poster which reads 007 for president that s a bit worrying if indeed mcmullin fancies himself as a james bond character but in a way it really sums up what his presidential run is all about working in the grey areas in back room meetings with gop establishment luminaries colored by private and public deception it s what the cia has specialized in for decades manipulating and perverting hundreds of overseas elections all in the interest of transnational corporate elites like mitt romney and now it seems they have an inside man nested in another key position oddly the media often introduces him as a conservative columnist seemingly in an effort to distract from his total insider pedigree mcmullin is no newcomer or fresh face he is a career operative inserted into special niches including his most recent stint as congressional director of gop policy now he s come out of the shadows to play a key role in the us election on behalf of some very powerful interests according to real clear politics mcmullin describes his work as a clandestine operative for the cia in both iraq and afghanistan in all the war zones post 9 11 until 2010 and most of the other hostile environments he admits his job was to penetrate insurgent and terrorist groups as well as foreign governments recruiting agents to pass information to take these people off the battlefield either capture or kill them interesting skill set penetrating governments we can safely assume that also entails subverting elections overseas or maybe using saudi arabian cash to buy weapons for jihadi terrorist rebels in syria not surprisingly mcmullin trumpets a loud anti putin and anti assad rhetoric which is almost perfectly in synchronization with that of hillary clinton s like clinton mcmullin relies on a campaign of fear set against russia and syria in an attempt to try to bracket trump togther with other overseas leaders currently under a demonization order by the washington dc establishment donald trump is an authoritarian just like vladimir putin just like bashar al assad just like the communist regime in china i have worked against and around authoritarians overseas and i know them when i see them donald trump is one of them he would bring the same kind of economic stagnation internal turmoil and discord to our country that other dictators bring to their own i m sure the kremlin considers donald trump by far its most successful intelligence operation ever it s very clear that vladimir putin and his regime have some control over donald trump trump s support for putin is the only thing he has been consistent on the following is straight off of mcmullin s campaign website under the heading of america s role in the world evan will impose tougher sanctions on russia and increase america s military presence in the baltics in order to deter and reverse putin s aggression rather than pretending that he is a partner for peace in syria evan will stand up for the rights of american and allied ships to sail freely in international waters rather than letting china dominate the western pacific this statement could ve just as well have written by the cia s office of forward information planning or from the office of hillary 2016 take your pick the next line in his r sum should also throw up a big red flag he s also a former operative at goldman sachs investment bank so cia and goldman sachs aside from bank rolling bill and hillary clinton s political machine for the better part of the last 15 years goldman also backed mitt romney s failed 2012 presidential run the connections here between all of these establishment players is undeniable with mcmullin sitting comfortably in his cia grey area stealing utah for hillary if we can send a strong message here from utah it will change the discussion in washington and across this country said mcmullin this is the problem with the contrived mcmullin campaign it will not impact the national political discussion since he announced his candidacy three months ago on august 8 2016 his campaign has only really existed inside utah but conveniently amplified by an us corporate mainstream media and the very same media outlets that have been demonstrably pro clinton anti sanders and anti trump since the very beginning of the presidential race evan mcmullin s primary directive seems to be to steal utah s 6 electoral votes away from republican candidate donald trump who is currently enjoying a comfortable lead over hillary clinton in utah recent polls show trump and mcmullin running neck and neck in utah at 30 and 29 respectively in an already tight national race between trump and clinton those 6 electoral votes could easily decide the national election in favor of hillary clinton aside from utah mcmullin is also hoping to steal away republic votes in key states with substantial mormon populations like arizona idaho and wyoming mcmullin is hoping to exploit mormon voter blocks over the issue of donald trump s bolshy demeanor and alleged past sex scandals a negative which will resonate with conservative mormon voters in places like utah based on the incredible amount of national media access he s being given across all of the top establishment broadcast tv networks it s pretty clear that the mcmullin campaign is being engineered at the highest levels for a candidate who appeared from nowhere in the last two months he s enjoyed carte blanche airtime including softball interviews on meet the press with chuck todd the week with george stephanopoulos as well as primetime slots on pro clinton media outlets cnn cbs nbc and of course on democratic party channel msnbc here s his debutant spot on morning joe where mcmullin waxes on about how george bush kept this country safe after 9 11 and other familiar platitudes when mcmullin speaks you can almost hear the voice of mitt romney and the old gop establishment if the republican party can t make the changes as wasn t able to do after 2012 the conservative movement will need a new political vehicle said mcmullin to stephanopoulos from these sort of statements we can see that the object of mcmullin s campaign is the same as romney s to keep the republican candidate from winning on november 8th establishment scion mitt romney photo left and his wall street partners are desperate and deathly frightened that if donald trump wins he will build a new gop power base one which is not based on a tight elite wall street investment bank circle that uses men like romney as their intermediary to control govemnent affairs and fix markets but rather real people power based on grassroots working class and middle class voters the other subtle piece of the mcmullin deception is how he constantly spins in the mainstream media about how a clinton victory is already a fait accompli in other words trump has already lost so cast your vote for me as a protest vote against the winner hillary clinton by applying that subtle spin mcmullin hopes to avoid being fingered as mitt romney s nevertrump tool getting on enough ballots in enough states requires money and a political machine enter the team romney mcmullin s ability to get on the ballot in 11 states and also write in access in 32 others was financed and run by a 501c3 not for profit organization which like mcmullin suddenly popped up this year it s called better for america said to be founded by gop operatives john kingston and joel searby when asked whether or not he s backed by mitt romney mcmullin always says no but the facts say otherwise here we can see clearly that mcmullin is a creation of mitt romney s so called nevertrump movement mcmullin s primary backer in this project appears to be kingston who just happens to be a former gop delegate from massachusetts and donor to former massachusetts governor mitt romney as well as executive producer for the 2014 documentary mitt in addition mcmullin s running mate is former mitt romney campaign staffer mindy finn aside from working in the bush administration finn also worked for twitter and google specifically building their tech networks with the washington beltway another total insider mcmullin has also been working with former mitt romney campaign strategist stuart stevens behind the patriotic rhetoric in better for america s marketing spin is well financed laser focused operation to steal utah from the republican party in public the organization claims that we deserve better than two candidates that are deeply unfavorable among a majority of the people they claim to represent together we can give a voice to the millions of americans who cannot in good conscience vote for either donald trump or hillary clinton if a third party candidate emerges they need to know the support they have on the ground among the nearly two thirds of americans said they are willing to support an independent candidate better for america s claim is disingenuous at best if not outright deceptive not least because there were already third and fourth party candidates gary johnson libertarian party and jill stein green party both of whom have been organizing in all 50 states this casual ignorance of the other alternative candidates indicates an attempt to totally manipulate the electoral conversation very underhanded yes but this is something a cia operative would be doing overseas thrawrting elections and destablizing fledgling democracies in target nations romney and goldman sachs end gamebeyond engineering a narrow victory for hillary clinton mitt romney and the nevertrump conclave s last option is to steal the election after nov 8th it goes like this their final play would be if neither trump nor clinton receive the 270 electoral college votes required for an outright victory which would then send the election to the house of representatives this hasn t happened since 1825 at this point a republican house of representatives many of whom are nevertrump supporters would choose any of the top three candidates who had won a state if mcmullin wins utah then he would theoretically be in with a chance but not as good a chance as hillary clinton would regardless either scenario although the clinton scenario is more real is predicated on evan mcmullin s role as a spoiler mcmullin admits this openly it depends on the race between hillary clinton and donald trump being very very close and it is not close now for clinton friends and campaign backers like goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein and fellow wall street elites a donald trump victory could mean an interruption in profits slowing down the financial organized crime and fiat paper fraud which has enriched them and the clintons and soon the obamas too ever since bill clinton gave goldman and co the ultimate blank check when the outgoing us president repealed the glass steagall act in 1999 with that one stroke of the pen the clintons set the stage for the 2008 financial collapse and bailout recipient blankfein and the goldman syndicate and romney too made vast fortunes off other people s misery notice that goldman and wall street have been stuffing money into the clinton s pockets ever since with speaking fees jobs investments and also bank rolling chelsea clinton s husband mark mezvinsky s hedge fund blankfein and his ilk brought the us economy to its knees and were paid handsomely for their effort it s an incestuous ring of financial skull duggery and you will not hear the righteous self styled liberty advocate evan mcmullin so much as mention any of this let alone bad mouth his former employer and criminal financial institution and yet this is the real story that everyone should really be talking about this election the seedy relationship between

brutality biting satire and darkly ironic media montages the enigmatic picture s overall depiction of the american media complex is just as effective today chaos road mickey and mallory knox are

clockwork orange 1971 nbk has also been thematically linked to network 1976 another motion picture with a scathing appraisal of mass media as well as the 1960 s road film easy rider 1969 and the strikingly similar dark thriller kalifornia 1993 which also starred juliet lewis playing a near identical role in many ways much of the media driven subtext of nbk has never seemed more relevant than

perhaps envisaging the multi platform information craze in the age of social media to this day the oliver stone directed controversial feature natural born killers based on a story by quentin tarantino remains a harsh critique of american media and pop culture as it casts a spotlight on the lurid agitprop used to steer public perception through various forms of infotainment over the course of this analysis we ll explore some of the underlying aspects of natural born killers as well as contextualize its relation to real life violence seen in the modern era cult of personality natural born killers reflects the heartless transformation of mass media on the road tragedy satirefrom the outset sight sound and mood take precedence over a traditional narrative structure throughout nbk the film begins with a roadside montage of predatory animals coyote eagle rattlesnake struggling to survive while leonard cohen s classic song waiting for the miracle slowly fades in creeping along to the foreboding imagery the sequence subliminally conjures the all too familiar eugenics based survival of the fittest axiom something which reflects the ruinous and fractured socio political environment that has become so pervasive in modern america all the while the action shifts dramatically from grainy black and white footage of america s southwest to a red filtered glow then back to full color as elliptical style editing as well as cross cutting and parallel sets the tone for the illusory motion picture magnified by its tension inducing dutch style camera angles 18 different film formats were used to create nbk in addition to many unusual lighting techniques everything from black and white to dusty old 8mm to 16mm to 35mm stock to cctv video and animation dine dash nbk sees

all american series leave it to beaver to 77 sunset strip a late 1950 s secret agent crime drama to the resignation speech of president richard nixon which is juxtaposed against an old horror film relic featuring boris karloff the short panning shot is emblematic of america s dark evolution during the 20th century and serves as a stark bell weather for the rest the high paced surreal picture in

mickey enters the frame falling in love with mallory at first sight mickey leaves with mallory and in the process steals ed s car later mickey is arrested and imprisoned managing to escape from a prison work farm during a tornado nbk s tornado prison break may be seen as a reference to the classic film the wizard of oz a storm system which forever alters mickey s future world mickey and mallory return to the wilson residence seeking revenge on mallory s father and mother in what could be seen as a loose interpretation of the dark lyrical finish to the enigmatic song the end by the doors the wilson s are murdered in a shocking home invasion scene and the house is set ablaze while mallory s brother kevin sean stone is set free during the inferno with each new set of kills mickey and mallory grow closer and after their demented oedipal electra complex resolution at the wilson residence the two get hitched in a blood ritual ceremony filmed on the scenic rio grande gorge bridge in taos new mexico here mickey proclaims the couple s marriage is sanctified because he is the god of his world conjuring friedrich nietzsche s overman concept as well as a apollonian dionysian influence within the killer s process in an analysis entitled the dionysian and the apollonian in nietzsche the birth of tragedy by alexander gatherer of cardiff university we are provided a more detailed look at both the apollonian and dionysian philosophical concepts the opposing concepts of the dionysian hereon di and apollonian hereon ap are central themes within nietzsche s first major work the birth of tragedy hereon bt his contemplation of such opposing forces of nature are primarily used to analyse greek culture in general and greek art in particular stating that its role in greek attic tragedy places these plays at greece s cultural pinnacle continuing gatherer s essay analyzes critical aspects of ap and di nietzsche s concepts of the ap and di along with the entirety of bt were not well received initially the author himself called the book badly written ponderous embarrassing image mad and image confused sweet 1999 p 49 however the ideas have left a notable legacy and are still discussed in matters of ethics politics and art indeed michael motta 1991 likens the opposing forces to mental illness stating how stages of mania in bipolar artists can be likened to that of the di the urge to create is great but the ability to step back to control the process is reduced with depressive phases linked to the ap critique and reflection take precedence over impulsivity inhibition holds sway over exhibitionism with this in mind we can interpret mickey and mallory s unresolved tension between ap and di as a philosophical reason for their dissent into madness although in stone s view mickey and mallory are tragically flawed because of a failed system which frames the prison system the police system and mass media as the true american criminals however this ideological stance of the film is itself a false paradigm stuck in a social justice vortex while masked in carl jung s rebel archetype pointing to stone s sometimes radical political perspective returning to nbk we see mickey and mallory make a blood pact and exchange snake rings presented by mickey who is connected to the reptilian realm via his caduceus chest tattoo at significant points during nbk snake imagery is observed recalling the occult and mythological associations of the serpent additionally there seems to be a shiva serpent attachment linked to mickey as a counterpart to mallory s kali connection with an underlying current of the symbol of immortality ouroboros other distorted biblical themes are also echoed during nbk such as the book of genesis and the garden of eden exemplified by mickey s assisted escape from prison by a rattlesnake many associations are often seen throughout nbk which reflect a deeper archetypal presence contained within the film in anton ehrenzweig s the hidden order of art we can explore a deeper analysis of the unconscious mind many elements that relate to the main characters in nbk some evidence of creative work and poemagogic phantasy points to incomplete superego maturation as an important source of mental illness the ego has not absorbed the death instinct into the mute workings of the creative process so that self destruction goes rampant to destroy entire itself in other words mickey and mallory lack any mature ethical component which leads to their shared self destructive psychosis which in turn is acted out in their murderous rage ehrenzweig coined the phrase poemagogic which is interpreted as an aspect emblematic of inducing the ego s creativity in a layered dream state the nightmare dream state of mickey and mallory visually comes to life in the strewn together time worn scenes of nbk like fragmented vitriolic memories blood bond a ritualistic roadside marriage filmed on the rio grande gorge bridge media made political agitatorswhen nbk continues all of the berserker like chaos is captured by wayne gale robert downey jr a ratings consumed tabloid host on the fictitious television series american maniacs a show which obsessively covers the violent action of mickey and mallory at any cost gale is an amalgam of australian tv s investigative host steve dunleavy and the long time reporter and talk show host geraldo rivera american maniacs uses the image of cult leader charles manson university of texas shooter charles whitman and the sadistic killer richard ramirez during its credits setting the tone for a sordid crime show reminiscent of the current affair and hard copy nbk s representation of popular true crime programming gives the film another disturbing art imitates life layer in one scene gale describes the targeted killing of several law enforcement officers at the hands of the knoxes which ironically reflects many real life crimes we see plastered across today s headlines in america all in all american maniacs very well could have been a template for the seedy video stringer film night crawler while packaged in the marketing gloss of american gladiators in a world of news makers gale says repetition works and when questioned over reusing reenacted death scenes by producers he callously exclaims do you think those nitwits out there in zombieland remember anything this is where we see gale s mind warping programming taking shape for maximum psychological impact this is what stone s film is truly about showcasing the often cold hearted and calculating nature of mass media s carefully engineered narrative with media analysis in mind we might also consider this passage from cult of distraction in the mass ornament by film theorist sociologist and writer siegfried kracauer here in pure externality the audience encounters itself its own reality is revealed in the fragmented sequence of splendid sense impressions were this reality to remain hidden from the viewers they could neither attack nor change it its disclosure in distraction is therefore of moral significance whether its banal programming intermixed with mass media s terror lens the viewer has a choice to accept the media manipulated distractions at wholesale or attempt to unpack them through critical thinking questioning the very nature of reportage american maniac gale s american maniacs glorifies tragedy for ratings as nbk moves forward we see the media trail and trial of mickey and mallory after the duo has been taken into custody in a mockumentary style scene centered around super fans and tacit supporters of the knoxes there s a decidedly social justice flair to a series of fictitious man on the street interviews the whole segment relates to various political agitator groups that we see today like occupy wall street ows and the controversial identity focused activism of black lives matter blm as well as the fbi and the cia s various counter intelligence programs from the 1960 s and 1970 s both ows and blm alliances are neo liberal think tank ngo designed gatherings meant to divide and control participants over class identity and other socio political concerns nbk s court house scene featuring fervid group think supporters could be seen as another signal of social strife in america at the turn of the century marked pointedly by the polarizing corruption of the 1992 l a riots the gross federal negligence of both the ruby ridge incident and the waco siege as well as the heavily publicized menendez murder case the strange and salacious trials of lorena bobbit and tonya harding and the show trial of o j simpson an all time ratings bonanza not counting the 95 million who watched simpson s car chase on live tv interestingly though the choreographed bombing of the world trade center 1993 carried out by fbi handlers and federal informants was a curiously under reported event at the time which could be a reason for its absence from the media montages seen throughout nbk the volatility of the 1990 s proved to be an ideal backdrop for nbk a picture made during a wave of high profile sensationalized crime motel mayhem the murderous bride and groom conjuring the death of mickey s innocence at the lodge later on in nbk with symbols fully on display we see close camera shots of the pair s tattoos mickey s light and dark yin and yang symbol and crudely drawn christ like tattoo are contrasted against mallory s scorpion ink as they ride along to abduct a hostage as they make their way to the neon lit log cabin lodge there very well could be a subtle reference to freemasonary when we witness the ritualistic behaviour shown at the lodge stylistically the motel resembles something out of the macabre cinematic world of david lynch in the background while mickey and mallory are on the motel bed projected images on a window pane range from clips of raging dictatorships to a young mickey haunted by his father s suicide and a pale horse recalling the book of revelations once again all of this takes place while a violent torture scene from the hollywood film scarface written by oliver stone plays out on the tv in front of their hostage when love turns dark mickey and mallory argue as time lapse imagery of a pray mantis is seen symbolizing the need for contemplation during their chaos the two separate briefly as shamanic chanting cascades over their turbulent night crimes with visions of terror projected onto the sides of buildings whether its quick cut edits of opposing and often disturbing montages mixing vitriolic live action clever special effects absurdly horror filled projections or startling animated graphics reminiscent of pink floyd s the wall nbk is a conceptual master work as the hallucinogenic and often kinetic film progresses a massive manhunt for the deranged knoxes is launched by detective jack super cop scagnetti a masochistic vigilante law man tom sizemore who has his own repressed demons to contend with which manifest in his psychotic behavior towards prostitutes we later learn that scagnetti s mother was gunned down by the infamous shooter charles whitman at the university of texas in 1966 roadside shaman the knoxes come face to face with themselves during red cloud s vision shifting mood once again we hear the haunting piano driven history repeats itself by a o s named after the 60 s counterculture chemist and sound engineer augustus owsley stanley iii which atmospherically plays in the background as mickey and mallory high on hallucinogens are lost out of gas and at odds with one another this is the first time mallory questions mickey and nature of events that led to her becoming a spree killer while looking for gas the knoxes approach red cloud and his grandson first passing by jacob four horned sheep revealing another biblical reference with the presence of the rare breed of sheep guardians this is another significant scene in nbk as the sovereign oglala lakota activist russell means adds unique depth to the sequence playing the navajo warren red cloud perhaps a reference to us marine mitchell red cloud once inside red cloud s hut the inner turmoil of the knoxes is exposed we then learn that red cloud served in the vietnam war reminding one of the staged gulf of tonkin false flag that led to the war the gulf of tonkin resolution which granted president lyndon b johnson the ability to militarily engage in a full scale conflict with north vietnam was made possible due to the fabrication of a crime during the latter half of the vietnam war the development of controversial counter terrorism techniques was at the utmost importance for then director of the cia william colby one such program materialized named the phoenix program operation phoenix which employed various terror tactics to destabilize the north vietnamese leadership claiming to have eradicated the vietcong through the use of psy ops extortion the release of criminals and random targeting of civilians to achieve its aims some geopolitical critics believe that this template for destabilization has been used in afganistan iraq libya and syria in recent years given that stone himself was a vietnam veteran in the us army we can view that the deliberate inclusion of red cloud s service record was a significant aspect to the story perhaps reflecting the false premise that the vietnam war was based upon skin walker mickey s inner demons come to the surface prior to killing red cloud the pivotal scene with red cloud dramatically altered the emotionally unhinged killers who were taken on a shamanic journey and forced to face their own reality during a cleansing ritual involving chanting fire and snakes here mickey s torment and abuse comes to the surface with vivid drug induced flashbacks and after being haunted by his past he awakens and shoots red cloud the tragic death of red cloud is the first time both mickey and mallory feel the weight of their actions with an axe to grind against mass murders mickey and mallory scagnetti manages to apprehend the pair in a dramatic shootout at the drug zone pharmacy after they were bitten by rattlesnakes following their quasi spiritual pilgrimage conducted by red cloud while observing the drug zone s logo we see the caduceus image winged staff wrapped with two snakes often inappropriately used in medicine as it is said to be the conductor of the dead drug zone subconscious slogans envelop mickey in the drug zone shootout with police this neon green filtered scene also represents the poisonous consumer culture as mickey and mallory drugged and snake bitten stalk to store for anti venom like the walking dead mike smith s energetic cartoon animation is also featured as the pharmacist id s the pair while watching gale s american maniacs mickey revels in his newfound celebrity catching himself on tv before he and mallory are taken in by scagnetti watchtower charles whitman opened fire on the 27th story of the university of texas clock tower on august 1st 1966 in one of the most well known mass shootings in american history image source hartford courant scagnetti later hatches a scheme to kill mickey and mallory with the fast talking neurotic warden dwight mcclusky tommy lee jones who plans his own twisted brand of justice inside the riotous batonga penitentiary when scagnetti s plot fails during nbk s prison riot scene mallory executes him in her cell scagnetti s fictitious link to a well known true crime merges the illusory world of nbk with the ut shooting subconsciously grafting fantasy onto a traumatic event in effect the concept mimics the way news stories sometimes strangely and unexpectedly overlap within a blended hyper reality of fact and fiction in recent years there has been a series of surreal and unreal news stories since the smith mundt act was effectively rendered obsolete by us lawmakers on july 2nd 2013 as confirmed by rt below until earlier this month a longstanding federal law made it illegal for the us department of state to share domestically the internally authored news stories sent to american operated outlets broadcasting around the globe all of that changed effective july 2 when the broadcasting board of governors bbg was given permission to let us households tune in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations the smith mundt act has ensured for decades that government made media intended for foreign audiences doesn t end up on radio networks broadcast within the us an amendment tagged onto the national defense authorization act removed that prohibition this year there has been an unprecedented increase in propaganda over the years despite claims that the ndaa provision offered more transparency to the american public on another note there are other uncanny historical elements associated with nbk fresh off his fame from the hit sitcom cheers woody harrelson was an intriguing choice to play the character mickey knox as it emerged that his father charles harrelson was a contract killer linked to organized crime charles was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named sam degelia jr in 1968 later in 1981 he received two life sentences for the murder of us district judge john h wood three tramps charles harrelson id d by forensic experts on the left is believed to be one of three arrested in dealey plaza after jfk s assassination in 1963 image source jfkmurdersolved it has been stated that after a six hour suicidal standoff with police in 1980 charles apparently high on cocaine admitted to killing judge wood while also claiming to be involved in president john f kennedy s assassination when considering the harrelson kennedy connection the 1989 book crossfire comes to mind crossfire written by the well known researcher jim marrs was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful oliver stone film jfk below is a passage from crossfire as it relates to the apparent harrelson kennedy link aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire harrelson the father of actor woody harrelson had a long history of involvement with dallas underworld characters linked directly to jack ruby continuing the crossfire also stated the late fort worth graphics expert jack white who testified before the house select committee on assassinations already had noticed the resemblance of harrelson to the youngest tramp in a 1981 interview with chuck cook harrelson claimed to have the biggest story the reporter would ever have when questioned about kennedy s death additionally jo ann harrelson noted the similarities between the tramp photos and her husband all this coupled with the fact diane lou oswald the mother of woody who had also been married to charles harrelson in midland texas made for a strange background concerning the jfk saga throughout 1981 more questions materialized regarding the assassination of judge wood in a upi article as defense lawyers maintained charles harrelson was framed by police and the informant charles an ex felon said a friend hampton robinson iii who failed to show up to testify had driven the car he suggested someone possibly federal agents had planted the guns so he could be arrested he denied telling department of public safety agent pagel he carried a gun below in a kdfw tv interview in 1982 charles harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing kennedy but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the us government s involvement in the death of kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in america the interview is a startling revelation adding to the enigmatic jfk mystery and in the process provides another strange backdrop to nbk do you believe lee harvey oswald killed president kennedy alone we ll get back to that alone without any aid from a rogue agency of the us government or at least a portion of that agency i believe your very naive if you do charles harrelsonon independence day in 1995 charles along with two other inmates gary settle and michael rivers tried to escape from atlanta federal penitentiary later surrendering after warning shots were fired by guards entropy ecstasy nbk s mass murder mayhem hits prime time tv fragmented psyche the death drive mind controlwhen exploring the concept of sigmund freud s death drive and its relation to nbk we should consider a thoughtful essay by jon mills entitled reflections on the death drive here we can gain a better understanding of the tension at play within the psyche of mickey and mallory freud did not argue that death thantos was the only aim of life only that it maintained a dialectical tension in juxtaposition to a life principle under the ancient command of eros yet the two forces of mind remained ontologically inseparable in this relational age the death drive appears to be a drowning man through this analysis we can see the tug of war within the main characters of nbk caught within a life and death cycle also observed throughout the nonlinear narrative of nbk are the media mobs and throngs of onlookers mesmerized by the murderous duo s violent deeds during the course of the film arguably revealing a schadenfreude joy derived from the misfortune of others in essence the abused become the abusers within the fragmented framework of nbk this twist to the story pushes the observer into accepting and perhaps identifying with the malevolent turn of the knoxes because of their own flawed and tragic upbringing this reality is recognized in the rise against perceived corruption particularly law enforcement in the form of social justice group think however this is where the film purposely presents a false paradigm to those subconsciously seeking their own radical retribution something which further fractures the viewer s perception by utilizing stereotypical patterns or in this case violent molds to excuse the rampage carried out by mickey and mallory knox this type of false paradigm forms a preconditioned response in favor of vigilantism preventing the viewer s ability to see things in an unbiased way which induces a type of cognitive dissonance in passive audiences blocking one from considering a rational outlook in the aftermath of trauma these concepts are central to understanding the nature of nbk as it stirs questions about morality societal behavior and the role played by both media and the public in an ongoing celebration of violence in this sense we can view nbk s excessive use of trauma based imagery as statement about the modern age a culture perpetually inundated by destructive media programming in many ways mind control abuse is heavily present within the topsy turvy world of nbk however its presence in the film should be seen not necessarily as an indoctrination of the viewer but perhaps as a warning to those unaware of the psychic assault on their senses from all kinds of media the film is laced with references to dissociative identity disorder did conjuring the cia s mind warping military backed program mk ultra an illegal project that used hypnosis sensory deprivation and other forms of torture to coerce an individual psychologically this is represented in the film s main characters as they vacillate between periods of ultra violent behaviour and delusional wishful daydreaming something which reflects a complex background of abuse here s an in depth abc news documentary examining project mk ultra and the role played by scottish american psychiatrist donald ewen cameron the heart of mk ultra is also seen in the controversial paper entitled from psyop to mindwar the psychology of victory written in part by the avowed satanist michael aquino a high ranking security official who was stated to have been inspired by lieutenant colonel john alexander s article on pyschotronics the employment of extrasensory perception the transmission and reception of information via the mind nbk s use of disturbing content might be best understood through its critique of mass media and the larger role that media has played in forcing trauma based imagery on the public in a manner similar to that of covert military projects in other words nbk s volatile imagery is meant to be a savage attack on media itself and should be observed as a critique on media abuse as a whole not something that overtly supports cruelty other aspects of abuse are also present in nbk whether it s mallory s unseen abuse by her father ed the hostage held captive by the psychotic pair at the lodge motel or scagnetti s deranged and vile coping mechanism for his own tragic upbringing towards the end of the film under a stockholm syndrome spell crack reporter gale attempts to transform himself for the sake of mickey and mallory this later leads to his demise when he discovers he s not truly a natural born killer we see the camera capture the action to tell the tale of mickey and mallory one more time in the film s final surreal sequence we see mickey and mallory driving in an rv as parents the idea here is that the knoxes represent a future society a future nuclear family one without traditional moral values transformed by the death of american culture this is something which is echoed by leonard cohen s song the future at the end of the film prison break mickey waxes poetic until a prison riot is sparked after talking to gale during the prison scene stone enlisted some 200 hardened criminals for the realistic riot scene cult crimes the daily shooterwhen concerning america s cult crimes investigative journalist maury terry and his book the ultimate evil comes to mind winding down a dark and treacherous path terry s research uncovered the dark details about the so called helter skelter killings also known as the tate labianca murders the son of sam shootings and other bizarre ritually crafted murders cascading across america from the 1960 s throughout the 1980 s in an article published by los angeles magazine writer michael bendrix discussed terry s controversial book and the web of terror surrounding the apparent satanic ritual abuse sra cult cases connected from coast to coast although manson and david berkowitz never knew each other they both belonged at different times and on different coasts to the same umbrella satanic cult organization called the process the process church s dark history splintered off from scientology also recalls the temple of set church a reboot of anton levay s church of satan as well as jim jones and the people s temple interestingly jones friend dan mitrione was an operative trained in advanced counterinsurgency techniques working with both the fbi and cia adding to the prevailing mystery of the brian jonestown massacre according to the researcher john judge jones once a poor preacher started people s temple after meeting mitrione judge uncovered much of the media manipulation in the aftermath of the brian jonestown massacre much of which was used to besiege the american public through a distortion of facts something that we see reflected in many high profile cases today in the arresting book programmed to kill by writer and researcher david mcgowan we see an examination of the american media and government agency propelled serial killer saga in a chapter entitled the myth of the serial killer here is a passage that directly relates to the narrative of nbk and in some cases crimes occurring in america today most americans are probably familiar with what is considered the classic serial killer profile this was a notion first put forth by the venerable fbi which coined the term serial killer and pioneered the concept of profiling in an alleged attempt to understand the phenomenon of mass murder it appears to be the case though the concept of the serial killer profile was put forth largely to misinform the public in the case of henry lee lucas few if any of the elements of the serial killer profile apply for instance serial killers are said to act alone driven to do so only by their own private demons so far removed from ordinary behavior are their actions that they would not indeed could not share their private passions with others in henry s case this is a patently false notion it has been officially acknowledged that lucas worked with not just one but at times as many as three accomplices later mcgowan links the cia s politically motivated counter insurgency campaign within vietnam operation phoenix to a domestic version operation chaos of terror featuring serial killings throughout the 1960 s in order to create a climate of fear to push for a police state crackdown the cia s operation chaos collected substantial amounts of information on domestic dissidents from 1967 to 1973 as admitted by the cia over 40 years ago a horrific crime spree took place sometime between 1972 1974 that was dubbed the zebra murders it was a shocking crime spree that shook the san francisco area to the core the murders were supposedly refered to as zebra because the radio communications channel that police talked over was channel z reportedly four black muslim men calling themselves the death angels were spawned from a known cointelpro hangout nation of islam the death angels were said to have shot future mayor of san francisco art angos some researchers on the subject have suggested that the death angels were trained counter intelligence assassins tasked with fomenting a race war in america in the 1990 s the idea of the lone serial killer phenomena faded into the background exploding with the revamped media driven image of the mass murder around every tabloid corner when the decade came to a close tabloid news produced the ratings that networks like abc cbs and nbc were starving for the news world changed after the o j simpson trial opening the door for larger outlets to run the type of sensational tv programming previously reserved for popular shows like a current affair hard copy and inside edition everything from salacious soft feature celebrity pieces to murder stories and courtroom dramas such as divorce court and judge judy seeped into regular television fair similarly in the world today the public has become reprogrammed by the fear based odyssey of the war on terror era and in more recent happenings such as the barrage of daily shooter mass casualty incidents rippling across america and europe in the form of gladio style operations we see another phase in the assault on reality these cases have risen to the forefront in media as there is only a passing footnote concerned about serial killings largely due to the public s desensitization this new kind of crimescape injects the collective hive mind with a host of socio political concerns over race religion reform and security while obscuring the forensic synopsis of a crime itself the notion that serial killers have in fact not acted alone under the lone wolf banner coincides with findings about many of today s mass shooters who in a number of cases covered here at 21wire have involved multiple suspects actors and drills most recently in america the events surrounding the orlando pulse night club were called into question as eye witness accounts suggested multiple suspects in the alleged lone wolf attack and that the authorities themselves may be to blame for some of the apparent deaths additionally back in 2013 the alleged pulse nightclub shooter omar mateen was placed under a terror watch list for 10 months interviewed three times by the fbi between 2013 14 having worked for one of the largest security firms g4s secure solutions headquartered in jupiter florida in the us and around the world since 2007 the firm was formerly part of a cia linked government contractor and security firm wackenhut corporation mateen s extensive background with g4s reveals another yet another curious connection between security and terror when discussing the mass shooter phenomena as it relates to terror and security writer and researcher jay dyer of jay s analysis stated the following the purpose of organized black op events is the psychological warfare effect of mass shootings all warfare is psychological warfare as the intent of the attacking party or army desires to bring about the acquiescence of the enemy warfare itself is merely a tool to bring about the psychological submission of the other side while the intention of wiping out the enemy forces are secondary why deplete one s own forces and resources if the enemy can be molded to think accordingly in this sense terrorism is the purposeful display of chaos and fear that arises from the radical disturbance of the normal daily patterns and social routines of the enemy with the intent of achieving an alteration in the psyche of the target populace indeed as critical pieces of daily shooter events come together evidence often suggests a highly organized and coordinated event involving many players those players then craft the three dimensions of how we are to view the event carrying out the event are as follows members of the police and security services and most crucially members of the global media the last and most important group provides the fourth dimension of this reality and that is you the public how you view any questionable event is the pinnacle for the architects of any impressive psy op a fifth dimension is based on the fourth which is how the architects and social engineers observe your reactions to the event from this data is collected social media is monitored then metered opinions are analyzed and public reactions are measured the conclusions will be used to form the baseline and design of future shock and awe operations reacting directly to the public s response casting crisis media fed madness hits the front page reality rebornin an exploratory essay entitled critical theories of mass media then and now written by paul a taylor and jan ll harris we can see clearer role of nbk and how it relates to the modern era the shock of the modern urban environment is figured in terms of a welter of new micro perceptions disorientating cuts and contingent images a realm of experience that also characterizes the cinematic experience cinema thus trains the sensorium and helps the subject adapt to this new technological social reality while nbk covers some dark and sometimes philosophical territory it often hints at something much darker than our imaginations can comprehend in this sense the viewer feels like a guilty voyeur in a culture of violence reliving trauma gratuitously through the callous and obsessive lens of mass media in the past critics and media have accused nbk itself of giving rise to copycat crimes as well as the columbine high school massacre and the dunblane massacre but interestingly these two high profile shootings from the 1990 s have a number of questionable elements forensically such as conflicting eyewitness testimony and how they were apparently carried out nbk can be thought of as an ultra or hyper reality an unreality more real than reality while critics of the film cite nbk s dangerous content and presentation it employs a heavy dose of artificial reality in order to inject certain universal truths about the nature of man and media in an article for ceasefire magazine andrew robinson deconstructs jean baudrillard s hyper reality a concept prominently observed while watching nbk hyperreality is a special kind of social reality in which a reality is created or simulated from models or defined by reference to models a reality generated from ideas the term has implications of too much reality everything being on the surface without mystery more real than reality too perfect and schematic to be true like special effects and para reality an extra layer laid over or instead of reality it is experienced as more real than the real because of its effect of breaking down the boundary between real and imaginary it is a real without origin or reality a reality to which we cannot connect in an informative piece by randy laist ph d entitled murder and montage oliver stone s hyperreal period we see a complex blended reality at play during nbk mickey and mallory are the icons of the new reality the image ripped out of its context the innocent killer the fictional character roaming free across the video prairies of the new manmade nature natural born killers elicits our own complicity with the cultural tendency it satirizes blending critique with enactment in a way that collapses the border between character and audience as well as between moralistic valuations of guilt and innocence in this perpetual age of terror highly sophisticated methods are used to alter distort and reform the public mind nbk was able to pull back the curtain on mass media s scripted reign read more alternative

the apparent bombings in new york city and new jersey this past week as bombs go off outside obama sails through the unga you have to wonder were the events in new york and new jersey also a weapon of mass distraction following a major international embarrassment for the united states both at home and abroad the brutal airstrike campaign in syria that killed over 70 syrian troops this unlikely bombing incident just happened to also coincide with the un general assembly in nyc where president obama was delivering among other speeches his war on terror addresses to the international community no surprise then with the city suddenly on high terror alert that obama quickly and confidently and comfortably used his center stage spotlight at the un shifting into national security mode boasting how quickly his police forces solved the case it was almost if he was ready for events that weekend the alleged nyc bombing suspect was named as 28 year old ahmad khan rahami who managed the family chicken kebab shop he has been charged with using weapons of mass destruction in addition to other criminal charges similar to what was described in the apparent boston marathon bombing of 2013 rahami is alleged to have created a homemade pressure cooker bomb which exploded in chelsea an affluent neighborhood of manhattan oddly missing are scenes depicting the transport of 31 injured individuals after the explosion in new york bomber or patsy ahmad khan rahami was known to both us officials and pakistani officials image source bbc nyc s known wolf after the mainstream media and officials floated the idea that a wireless emergency alert system helped to locate and find rahami with an electronic wanted poster it turns out the fbi already knew him according to the washington post the fbi had already known rahami since 2014 making this latest known wolf attack a strongly suspicious event the fbi s probe into ahmad khan rahami the 28 year old named as the only suspect in the bombings was launched based on comments his father had made an official said his father later recanted his comments agents conducted interviews checked with other agencies and looked at internal databases none of which revealed ties to terrorism the bureau said in a statement but why then was rahami on the radar of pakistani intelligence in recent years during the san bernardino caper last december we were told that supposedly pakistani born tashfeen malik had ties to the red mosque in pakistan a well known inter services intelligence isi linked mosque sources have told daily mail online that us officials handed over information to their pakistani counterparts about links between tashfeen malik and the red mosque in islamabad the mosque is infamous for its links to violence and authorities in pakistan are now considering taking action against its preacher maulana abdul aziz after the disclosures by us officials if malik was inspired by isis as claimed by authorities via social media then why did her background suggest a pakistani isi cia al qaeda connection if she was in fact radicalized as us plot writers insist the uk s telegraph stated that the part of pakistan where malik was staying is known as a recruiting ground for al qaeda linked islamist groups including lashkar al taiba responsible for a bloody attack in mumbai india s financial capital in 2008 if true this was a new twist in the media hyped san bernardino shooting displaying a startling link between the al qaeda isi affiliated red mosque and other western backed black ops in pakistan in may of 2011 the council on foreign relations cfr outlined the isi s material support for various militant groups including the formation of al qaeda giving historical context to recent events the isi s first major involvement in afghanistan came after the soviet invasion in 1979 when itpartnered with the cia to provide weapons money intelligence and training to the mujahadeen fighting the red army the cfr further stated pakistan s government has repeatedly denied allegations of supporting terrorism citing as evidence its cooperation in the u s led battle against extremists the cia and isi have had a long sometimes contentious relationship on the surface but the reality is that their collective footprint is all over many tribal areas in pakistan and places like afghanistan where extremism continues to grow to this day malik s affiliations suggested that she could have been involved with one of the intelligence agencies active in the exact location she resided in pakistan was this also the case with rahami given his link to a pakistani seminary with ties to the taliban the uk s guardian reported the following the 28 year old who was born in afghanistan but became a us citizen spent time at the kaan kuwa naqshbandi madrasa on his two visits to pakistan a security official working for the government of balochistan province told the guardian cointinuing the article discussed how pakistani officials have limited the information they have about rahami us officials have revealed basic details about rahami s two visits to pakistan the first in 2011 when he spent a couple of months in quetta and got married and almost a year in 2013 when he also made a car journey to afghanistan but very little information has emerged from inside pakistan about what rahami did during his visits the government official who did not wish to be named because he was speaking about a highly sensitive subject said pakistani security agencies have tried to hide all the details of his visits to quetta and keep as much information as possible out of the media it s also worth noting the similarities of this case to that of another known wolf who traveled overseas before a major domestic event the alleged boston bomber tamerlan tsarnaev who had previously been recruited by the fbi most likely as an informant this might help to explain why tamerlan traveled overseas to attend the

appearing once again to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready made laundry list of hateful rhetoric and random writings as an ironclad motive for a crime the aftermath in the case of new york is no different as it rapidly descended into an overindulgent barrage of media speculation and theorizing all too often we ve seen the stage persona of any alleged attacker or killer being touted as hard evidence despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis and debate potentially without a definitive conclusion

shooter operation ever involving more than 200 nypd and fdny officers it was the ninth full scale exercise of its kind since the beginning of 2014 chief of nypd counterterrorism bureau james waters explained that the drill replicated portions of events that occurred in san bernadino in the bataclan in paris and in australia continuing the article described the intricate mass exercise on the third and the fourth floors we had additional explosions go off replicating things that happened at the bataclan nightclub and that pushed the esu officers up to the third floor and finally the fourth floor where they encountered a barricade with a hostage situation he said explaining that the cops again were able to stop the shooters for the average person its hard to differentiate from a drill or

week that facebook inc fb o has been slow to cooperate the company and others have said they are turning over information but also that they are legally obligated to protect their users privacy on visits to capitol hill on wednesday and thursday sheryl sandberg facebook s chief operating officer met with leaders of the house intelligence committee and said the company wanted to help investigators and would turn over more information things happened on our platform that shouldn t have happened in the lead up to the election sandberg told the axios website on thursday so far however the congressional sources said investigators have found it hard to extract all the relevant information from silicon valley about alleged russian activity but the committees have so far seen no need to issue subpoenas for the data the sources added facebook and other major internet companies including alphabet inc s google googl o and twitter inc twtr n have faced a stream of recent revelations about how moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the united states and influence the election in favor of the republican white house candidate donald trump facebook disclosed last month that it had found some 3 000 politically divisive advertisements believed to have been bought by russia before and after the presidential campaign the company has now shared with congressional investigators the ads information on how they were paid for and how they were targeted a facebook spokesman said sandberg told congressional investigators on thursday that in addition to the ads the company would provide the rest of the information from accounts linked to russia the spokesman said the sources said investigators were also pressing twitter google and other companies for similar data and urging twitter to conduct a more comprehensive search of its data banks we have a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion a google spokeswoman said asked about the issue we are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems working with researchers and other companies and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries a twitter spokesperson did not respond to an email requesting comment twitter has likely not released all potentially relevant data to congressional investigators in part because of their policy requiring a court order and their track record of defending user privacy by fighting such requests adam sharp former head of news and government at twitter said in an interview twitter engineers are trying to regenerate some of the lost data and may be able to retrieve some of it said a person familiar with the company s technology the use of social media platforms was part of what u s intelligence agencies have concluded was a broader russian effort to meddle in the election campaign an allegation the kremlin has denied several congressional committees as well as special counsel robert mueller are investigating russian interference including any potential collusion between trump associates and moscow trump has denied any such collusion in september facebook disclosed that it had evidence that an operation based in russia had spent 100 000 on thousands of sponsored posts promoting divisive social and political messages in a two year period through may 2017 facebook said it believed the messages were likely bought by people in russia before and after the 2016 election sources familiar with facebook s contacts with congress said that as recently as july this year company officials were denying the existence of any paid russian messaging and only later acknowledged that the company had found 100 000 in sponsored traffic linked to 478 facebook accounts the sources said investigators think the paid messaging was generated by a group called the internet research agency in st petersburg u s officials have called it a troll factory that creates false identities or copies real ones to spread real skewed and fake information for the kremlin congressional sources said some of the facebook messaging went to groups with seemingly legitimate names such as heart of texas defend the second and united muslims of america which they said all had as many as 250 000 followers these groups now appear to have been bogus or set up to look like legitimate political organizations and investigators want to learn more about the groups their followers and their origins the sources said they said facebook lawyers have

more of the burden in combating islamist militants while acknowledging that the threat of terrorism will never be totally eliminated the 11 page draft seen on friday by reuters said the united states should avoid costly open ended military commitments we need to intensify operations against global jihadist groups while also reducing the costs of american blood and treasure in pursuit of our counterterrorism goals states the document which is expected to be released in coming months we will seek to avoid costly large scale u s military interventions to achieve counterterrorism objectives and will increasingly look to partners to share the responsibility for countering terrorist groups it says however it acknowledges that terrorism cannot be defeated with any sort of finality michael anton spokesman for the white house national security council said as part of its overall approach the administration is taking a fresh look at the entire u s national security strategy to include the counterterrorism mission which is especially important since no such strategy has been produced publicly since 2011 the process is aimed at ensuring the new strategy is directed against the pre eminent terrorist threats to our nation our citizens our interests overseas and allies anton said moreover this new strategy will highlight achievable and realistic goals and guiding principles combating islamic extremism was a major issue for trump during the 2016 presidential campaign the draft strategy paper which officials said was still being fine tuned at the white house describes the threat from islamic militant groups in stark tones it remains to be seen how trump can square his goal of avoiding military interventions with ongoing conflicts involving u s troops in iraq syria afghanistan yemen and elsewhere rather than scale back u s commitments he has so far largely adhered to former obama administration plans to intensify military operations against militant groups and granted the pentagon greater authority to strike them in places like yemen and somalia trump may soon reverse years of obama ordered drawdowns in afghanistan his administration is now considering boosting by 3 000 to 5 000 soldiers the 8 400 strong u s contingent helping afghan forces fight a resurgent taliban current and former u s officials say a senior administration official noted that only a small number of troops have been added to u s forces in iraq and syria under trump at the discretion of his military commanders if you do see additions elsewhere they will be in keeping with this draft strategy said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity the increased pace of u s military operations has seen a recent spate of american casualties the latest came in somalia where a navy seal died and two others were wounded in an attack by al shabaab militants u s officials said on friday since president barack obama released the last u s counterterrorism strategy in 2011 before the emergence of islamic state the threat has diversified in size scope and complexity from what we faced just a few years ago the draft strategy said in addition to islamic state the united states and its allies are endangered by a reconstituted al qaeda groups such as the haqqani network and hezbollah as well as from homegrown extremists radicalized online it said bruce hoffman director of georgetown university s center for security studies and who reviewed the document at reuters request said the draft strategy paints and i think accurately a more dire picture of the threat than the obama document which sounded a triumphalist tone following al qaeda leader osama bin laden s death in a 2011 u s raid in pakistan the senior administration official said the document describing an overarching counterterrorism approach is separate from a detailed strategy to defeat islamic state that trump also has ordered the draft strategy seen by reuters appears to flow from trump s america first foreign policy calling for foreign aid cuts and more burden sharing by allies and alliances such as nato it does not include a signature phrase from trump s 2016 campaign radical islamic terrorism instead it says that jihadist groups have merged under a global jihadist ideology that seeks to establish a transnational islamic caliphate that fosters conflict on a global scale the draft s first guiding principle is that the united states will always act to disrupt prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against our nation our citizens our interests overseas and our allies this includes taking direct and unilateral action if necessary the administration would boost u s homeland security by working with allies and partners to eliminate terrorist leaders ideologues technical experts financiers external operators and battlefield commanders the draft also calls for denying militants physical and online sanctuaries in which to plan and launch attacks and degrade their efforts to develop and deploy chemical and biological weapons yet it provides few details on how the united states which has led global counterterrorism efforts since the sept 11 2001 attacks can achieve those goals by passing more of the burden to other countries many of which lack the requisite military and intelligence capabilities the draft makes little mention of promoting human rights development good governance and other soft power tools that washington has embraced in the past to help foreign governments reduce grievances that feed extremism in contrast the obama counterterrorism strategy made respecting human rights fostering good governance respecting privacy and civil liberties committing to security and transparency and upholding the rule of law the foremost of its guiding principles soft power has a role to play but not to the exclusion of kinetics or military action said hoffman he called the draft a very sober depiction of the threat and what is needed now and in the immediate future to counter it',\n",

independence push as madrid s high court signaled a hardening line by jailing the leaders of two of the largest separatist organizations in the first imprisonment of senior secessionist figures since catalonia s oct 1 independence referendum the court ordered the heads of the catalan national assembly anc and omnium held without bail pending an investigation for alleged sedition prosecutors say that the anc s jordi sanchez and omnium s jordi cuixart played central roles in orchestrating pro independence protests that last month trapped national police inside a barcelona building and destroyed their vehicles around 200 people flocked to the catalan government s headquarters in barcelona in a peaceful show of support for both men with some chanting freedom and waving democracy banners the anc which has organized protests of hundreds of thousands of secessionists in the past called for further peaceful demonstrations around catalonia on tuesday catalan regional president carles puigdemont commented on twitter spain jails catalonia s civil society leaders for organizing peaceful demonstrations sadly we have political prisoners again an allusion to spain s military dictatorship under francisco franco the high court also banned the catalan police chief josep lluis trapero from leaving spain and seized his passport while he is being investigated over the same incident though it did not order his arrest last tuesday puigdemont stepped back from asking the catalan parliament to vote on independence instead making a symbolic declaration and calling for negotiations on the region s future in a confrontation viewed with mounting alarm in european capitals and financial markets puigdemont failed on monday to respond to madrid s ultimatum to clarify whether he had declared unilateral independence in a speech last week he now has until thursday to back down in a letter to spanish prime minister mariano rajoy puigdemont gave no direct answer on the independence issue instead making a sincere and honest offer for dialogue over the next two months in reply rajoy said puigdemont s stance had brought madrid closer to triggering article 155 of the constitution under which it can impose direct rule on any of the country s 17 autonomous communities if they break the law the catalan government s campaign to break away from spain has pitched the country into its worst political crisis since an abortive coup attempt in 1981 on monday the economy ministry told the eu that it had slashed its economic growth forecasts for next year partly due to the situation the catalan government says 90 percent of voters in the referendum backed a breakaway but turnout was only 43 percent as most opponents of independence in the region boycotted the vote already declared illegal by spain s constitutional court thousands have demonstrated in barcelona and other spanish cities both for and against independence so far the crisis has been largely violence free except for the day of the referendum when national police assaulted voters with batons and rubber bullets the high court ruled that trapero the catalan police chief would have his passport withdrawn but rejected a request from the state prosecutor for him to be held in custody trapero is a hero to the secessionists after his force took a much softer stance than national police in enforcing the ban on the referendum prosecutors say he failed to give orders to rescue national police trapped inside the barcelona building puigdemont last tuesday delayed by several weeks a formal declaration of independence from spain to allow for talks madrid has ruled out talks unless puigdemont gives up the independence demand it had given him until 10 a m 0800 gmt on monday to clarify his position with a yes or no and until thursday to change his mind if he insisted on a split following his failure to do so a regional broadcaster said he also planned to ignore a final deadline on thursday suggesting that puigdemont and his team were in no mood to follow rajoy s game plan catalan interior minister joaquim forn said article 155 would not allow madrid to remove members of the catalan government the article s terms on direct rule which has never been applied are vague it says madrid can adopt any measure to force a region to meet its constitutional obligations with the approval of spain s lower house the wording suggests this could include anything from taking control of regional police and finances to installing a new governing team or calling a snap election underlining the deepening crisis some of the largest companies in prosperous catalonia which accounts for a fifth of the spanish economy have already shifted head offices elsewhere and others are

director of orthopaedic trauma service at the hospital for special surgery as well as the chief of the orthopedic trauma service at newyork presbyterian hospital was found dead in his apartment earlier this week according to new york city police he committed suicide by stabbing himself to death that s a pretty normal way to commit suicide right it s like the time when former president of the united nations general assembly john ashe was found dead in his apartment only days before he was set to testify against the clintons in a corruption case the official reports indicated that ashe died of a heart attack the problem however is that police on the scene reported ashe died when his throat was crushed during a work out accident adding to the mysterious nature of ashe s death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court monday with his chinese businessman co defendant ng lap seng from whom he reportedly received over 1 billion in donations during his term as president of the u n general assembly and then there was this during the presidency of bill clinton seng illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the democrat national committee now abc news is reporting an acclaimed trauma surgeon was found dead with a knife in his torso sunday in his park avenue apartment in a suspected suicide new york city police said dr dean lorich 54 was the associate director of the orthopedic trauma service at the hospital for special surgery who treated bono in 2014 after the u2 frontman was badly injured in a cycling accident in central park lorich was also a professor at weill cornell medical college his death is being investigated as an apparent suicide a new york police department official told abc news initial investigations did not find any signs of forced entry at his apartment the official said authorities have not found a suicide note police responding to a 911 call of an assault in a park avenue apartment at 1 05 p m sunday found lorich unconscious and unresponsive with a knife in his torso according to the nypd emergency medical service responders pronounced him dead the email wikileaks published was highly critical of the failed relief efforts in haiti and was shared by cheryl mills with hillary clinton in 2010 lorich was part of a relief effort that flew to haiti as a volunteer to offer his skills for civilians who had been injured during the earthquakes that devastated the region within 24 hours of the earthquake a 13 member team of surgeons anesthesiologists and operating room nurses was assembled with a massive amount of orthopedic operating room equipment and flew to port au prince with dr lorich bill and hillary clinton s charitable clinton foundation led the relief effort in haiti raising millions of dollars from around the world to help the people recover from the natural disaster sadly most of the funds never reached the people of haiti but instead lined the pockets of the clintons associates who were meant to redevelop the nation but never delivered dr lorich and his team were there to help save the limbs of those injured which without the proper medical treatment would have meant amputation for a lot of people lorich described amputation in those conditions as a death sentence and hoped to treat as many sufferers as possible saying we expected many amputations but we thought we could save limbs that were salvageable particularly those of children we recognized that in an underdeveloped country a limb amputation may be a death sentence it does not have to be so with the amount of money that was being donated to haiti for the victims lorich and his team expected to have full support when their plane touched down instead he described the situation as shameful and witnessed first hand a huge misappropriation of funds with the people affected by the disaster receiving no help whatsoever dr lorich was disgusted by what he saw and sent an email to then secretary of state hillary clinton s chief of staff cheryl d mills to report what he had seen in july 2017 a 50 year old haitian tied to the clinton foundation was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head it s no secret that the clinton foundation has been facing credible reports of robbing impoverished haitians who were devastated by hurricane hanna in 2008 through their foundation haitians have been protesting for years outside of the clinton foundation offices over the theft of money that was donated by individuals and businesses to the clinton foundation that never made it to the poorest of the poor one man was set to testify against the clinton foundation next week that man was 50 year old former haitian government official klaus eberwein he was found dead in his miami home with a gunshot to the head that s been ruled a suicide by the miami dade s medical examiner records supervisor think vince foster klaus eberwein a former haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of clinton foundation corruption and malpractice next week has been found dead in miami he was 50 eberwein was due to appear next tuesday before the haitian senate ethics and anti corruption commission where he was widely expected to testify that the clinton foundation misappropriated haiti earthquake donations from international donors eberwein who had acknowledged his life was in danger was a fierce critic of the clinton foundation s activities in the caribbean island where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency fonds d assistance conomique et social for three years according to eberwein a paltry 0 6 of donations granted by international donors to the clinton foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting haitians actually ended up in the hands of haitian organizations a further 9 6 ended up with the haitian government the remaining 89 8 or 5 4 billion was funneled to non haitian organizations the clinton foundation they are criminals they are thieves they are liars they are a disgrace eberwein said at a protest outside the clinton foundation headquarters in manhattan last year the former director general of haiti who also served as an advisor to haitian president michel martelly was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in haiti muncheez and even has a pizza the klaus special named after him according to the haiti libre newspaper eberwein was said to be in good spirits with plans for the future his close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide it s really shocking said muncheez s owner gilbert bailly we grew up together he was like family your news wireamericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the clinton crime family when in september of 2016 former senate president of haiti bernard sansaricq shocked a large crowd at a trump campaign event in little haiti fl sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the clinton s dirty dealings in haiti while he was still in office to his credit candidate donald trump allowed sansaricq to speak his mind and to expose the crimes of the clinton s who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our white house sansaricq claimed he begged the clinton administration not to invade haiti his request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the white house who encouraged him to side with the clinton administration and he would be the richest man in haiti he also demanded that hillary clinton disclose the audit of all money related to the haiti earthquake crisis as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of haiti out of billions of dollars through the clinton foundation not even 2 of that money went back to haiti so mr trump we are asking you begging you the haitian community will side with you if one day you ask hillary clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from haiti in 2010 after the

virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female born transgender high school student from using the boys bathroom the justices agreed to hear the gloucester county school board s appeal of a lower court s april 19 ruling that transgender students are protected under u s laws barring sex based discrimination the case involves a 17 year old transgender student named gavin grimm who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the school s boys bathroom the case to be argued and decided before the end of june will be one of the biggest of the court s term i never thought that my restroom use would ever turn into any kind of national debate the only thing i ever asked for was the right to be treated like everyone else grimm said in a statement the court s decision to take the case means grimm will not be able to use the boys bathroom before graduating from high school next year said josh block his lawyer at the american civil liberties union these sorts of discriminatory policies stigmatize and isolate transgender students like gavin just because of who they are block added the school board s chairman troy anderson welcomed the court s decision to hear the case saying the board s policy carefully balances the interests of all students and parents conservative groups have backed the school board saying the fight is about student privacy rights in light of the right to bodily privacy federal law should not be twisted to require that a male be given access to the girls facilities or a female to the boys facilities said gary mccaleb a lawyer with the alliance defending freedom a conservative christian legal group at the heart of the case is the question of whether transgender people are covered by a ban on gender discrimination in education under federal law president barack obama s administration concluded that they are but there is a legal fight over whether judges are required to defer to the government s view the justices could side step a major ruling by focusing their decision on whether the administration followed the correct procedure when it gave public notice about that legal conclusion the court remains one justice short following the february death of antonin scalia which left it with four conservatives and four liberals that raises the possibility of a 4 4 ruling that would leave in place the decision favoring grimm by the richmond based 4th u s circuit court of appeals a 4 4 ruling would set no nationwide legal precedent the court until now had generally steered clear of taking potentially divisive cases while it remained shorthanded the supreme court has not directly ruled on transgender rights before but in 1994 the court did rule in favor of a male born transgender prison inmate identifying as a woman who was held with male prisoners and said she was beaten and raped by another inmate whether to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity rather than their birth gender has become the latest flashpoint in the long u s battle over lesbian gay bisexual and transgender rights in a major gay rights ruling in 2015 the supreme court legalized same sex marriage nationwide the transgender fight heated up after north carolina passed a republican backed law in march that required people to use bathrooms that corresponded to their gender at birth in government buildings and public schools the north carolina law being challenged in court also blocked local measures protecting lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people from discrimination the obama administration in may issued nationwide guidance telling public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice that guidance infuriated many conservatives and prompted a republican led legal effort to fight it twenty three states sued to block the guidance a u s district court judge on aug 22 issued a nationwide injunction sought by texas and other states preventing the administration from enforcing the guidance in the virginia case the supreme court in july voted 5 3 to temporarily block the appeals court decision from going into effect while the litigation continued a move that prevented grimm from using the boys bathroom when the new school year began in september grimm began attending school as a boy in september 2014 with the school s permission grimm used the boys bathroom for about seven weeks without incident but after complaints from parents the county school board adopted a new policy in december 2014

kyi made the remarks in her first address to the nation since attacks by rohingya muslim insurgents on aug 25 led to a military response that has forced 421 000 rohingya muslims more than half of them children into neighboring bangladesh western diplomats and aid officials hoping for an unequivocal condemnation of violence and hate speech welcomed the tone of the nobel peace laureate s message but some doubted if she had done enough to deflect global criticism long feted in the west as a champion of democracy in the buddhist majority country during years of military rule and house arrest suu kyi has faced growing criticism for saying little about abuses faced by the rohingya we condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence we are committed to the restoration of peace and stability and rule of law throughout the state suu kyi said in her address in the capital naypyitaw action will be taken against all people regardless of their religion race and political position who go against the law of the land and violate human rights she said in a phone call to suu kyi u s secretary of state rex tillerson welcomed the myanmar government s commitment to allow the return of refugees but urged it to facilitate humanitarian aid to those affected by the violence and to address deeply troubling human rights abuse allegations the state department said britain said it had suspended its military training program in myanmar and french president emmanuel macron condemned unacceptable ethnic cleaning he told the annual u n general assembly he would start a u n security council initiative to ensure humanitarian access and an end to the violence u n secretary general antonio guterres told the general assembly the authorities in myanmar must end the military operations allow unhindered humanitarian access and recognize the right of refugees to return in safety and dignity and they must also address the grievances of the rohingya whose status has been left unresolved for far too long a european union spokeswoman said suu kyi s invitation to the diplomatic corps to visit rakhine was a step forward but added myanmar s leadership needs to show that the democracy they fought so hard for can work for all the people of myanmar beyond ethnic social and religious boundaries at the general assembly nigerian president muhammadu buhari likened the violence in myanmar to genocides in bosnia and rwanda while turkish president recep tayyip erdogan cited the international community s failure in syria unless the tragedy taking place in myanmar is brought to a halt humanity will have to live with the shame of another dark stain in its history erdogan said twenty two members of the u s congress wrote to tillerson calling for a strong meaningful response to the crisis and the head of the influential senate foreign relations committee bob corker said suu kyi risked destroying her reputation as a force for positive change she had yet another opportunity today to stand up for the rohingya minority but instead refused to acknowledge the military s role in the ongoing atrocities he said amnesty international described suu kyi s speech as little more than a mix of untruths and victim blaming saying she and her government were burying their heads in the sand for ignoring the army s role in the violence myanmar s generals remain in full charge of security and suu kyi did not comment on the military or its actions except to say there had been no armed clashes and there have been no clearance operations since sept 5 rohingya refugees arriving in bangladesh have told of soldiers and buddhist civilians attacking and burning villages as recently as last friday it was not possible to verify their accounts rights monitors and fleeing rohingya say the army and rakhine buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the muslim population the u n rights agency said it was a textbook example of ethnic cleansing myanmar rejects the charge saying its forces are tackling insurgents of the arakan rohingya salvation army who it has accused of setting the fires and attacking civilians western governments that backed suu kyi s campaign against military rule still see her as the best hope for myanmar s political and economic transition but she has to avoid angering the powerful army and alienating supporters by being seen to take the side of a muslim minority that enjoys little sympathy in a country that has seen a surge of buddhist nationalism phil robertson of human rights watch said satellite images showed about half of all rohingya villages had been torched and it was time that suu kyi the government and military faced the fact that the security forces shoot and kill who they want suu kyi 72 said her

the state s secretary tin maung swe told reuters adding that tensions were high the situation is ready to explode suu kyi said she was committed to recommendations made by the advisory team led by kofi annan a former u n secretary general which last month suggested a review of a law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most rohingya stateless on the return of refugees suu kyi said

down at this most crucial moment admittedly some of those commentators had a point it s difficult to look away from the fact that one of the most staunchly anti woman candidates gallivanted into

in a state where the governor and secretary of state are republicans i live in the very blue state of michigan where both offices are held by republicans and i beg to differ i was a poll challenger in the city of pontiac mi in 2012 and again in 2014 the video below is an interview i did with dennis michael lynch where i discuss the unbelievable corrupt behavior by the poll supervisor and voter fraud i witnessed dennis starts out the video by discussing republican governor rick snyder although i am no fan of the governor s i m not sure he ever knew about the decision by the gop to ignore the voter fraud we witnessed but republican secretary of state ruth johnson s office was fully aware of the voter fraud we witnessed and chose to look away my best friend and business partner leisa and i asked to go to detroit in 2012 to work as poll challengers we were given the assignment left early in the morning and headed into what we were sure was going to be a contentious day we couldn t have been more wrong the women who were supervising the polling places were serious and followed the rules to a tee besides the fact that every voter coming into the polling place had what is called a black slate that s essentially a mock up of the ballot with the spots marked where voters were expected to fill in we couldn t find a single irregularity or rule that wasn t being followed the black slate was a sort of cheat sheet for uniformed voters there were no decisions that had to be made by the voter just fill in the ovals exactly as they appeared on the black slate and voil you ve voted no need to pick candidates judges or even to make decisions on ballot proposals they ve already been made for you by whomever decided how black michigan residents should vote we were pleased to see that there weren t any issues at the detroit polling place so we decided to move to pontiac where a friend had been messaging us about some strange things that were happening she had never been a poll challenger before but was wondering if people should have been putting their own ballots in the machine in the early morning hours just after the opening of the polls upon entering the polling place we were greeting by a supervisor she was a black woman with a very stern look on her face we smiled handed her a box of donuts introduced ourselves and said we were working for the republican party as poll challengers her response was i ll be watching you watching me that was just the start of what turned out to be a very contentious day at the polls i spent the day with my good friend dennis michael lynch driving around detroit and talking to people about jobs and other issues while we were driving dennis asked me to tell him my story although it s not my most flattering angle lol here is my story there were 3 precincts within one building where we landed in pontiac the black female supervisor at the precinct where i was working was getting very frustrated by presence at the polls it was pretty clear they were not conditioned to having anyone watch the voting process as the workers and supervisors all appeared to be on edge as voters came through they were asked to show identification in order to get their registration form after they received their white voter registration form they moved down the line for the next person who had a voter roll book with the names and addresses of the voters the person with the book was supposed to check the picture id against the name on the form and the name in the book the person with the book appeared to be intentionally blocking me out so i couldn t see the book i tried to lean around him and the supervisor yelled at me to get back she kept saying you re making him uncomfortable i continued to move around until i could find a spot within the boundaries i was allowed to stand in so i could be sure the voters names were matching those in the voter roll book every time i would start to get a closer look he would slam the book shut and either say their names were in the book or that they weren t in which case he would pull out his flip phone and dial a number he claimed he was calling the city clerk and after giving the voters name he would say the clerk said it was okay for them to vote i would challenge the vote as i couldn t see the book or the voters name on their id the supervisor would ignore me over and over again i said i wanted to challenge the vote and she ignored me at one point things became so heated that she pressed her chest up against mine and was physically threatening me to back away from the process i refused and the voters in the line began to cheer for her like we were in some sort of cage match after several sos phone calls to the mi republican party hotline they finally sent an attorney who witnessed the supervisor ignoring me when i asked for her to challenge the vote leisa the attorney who was working for the gop or mitt romney we never got a straight answer about who he was working for from the gop and i took notes we were all stunned at what we witnessed i waited a few days after mitt romney s devastating defeat hoping i would hear from someone in the republican party i never did several days later i took it upon myself to call the mi gop party chairman who at the time was bobby schostak i relayed part of my story to him he didn t seem to be very interested and told me to call our republican secretary of state ruth johnson i called her office and explained why i was calling i never heard back i called the person who scheduled us at the polling place and asked if the attorney was going to move forward with charges he told us if the gop was going to do anything they would likely contact me we never heard back from anyone two years later we returned to the same polling place and again witnessed more shenanigans this time they were ready for us large men appeared out of nowhere and lined up against the wall directly across from where i was standing they were watching me on several occasions one of them would come up and ask me why i was there i explained i was only protecting the sanctity of the vote and it wasn t a republican or democrat thing protecting the sanctity of our vote was for the good of every american he sneered and walked away when things became heated between a poll worker and me because she kept insisting i was making her uncomfortable i called and begged for the republican party to send a representative to help us out when they finally sent someone the city clerk approached us and told me he had to leave i explained that he could be there so she called a sheriff to come down and deal with me together they threatened to have me arrested if i continued to break the rules i explained i wasn t breaking any rules and reminded the sheriff that if he was going to threaten me he should understand the law ten minutes later the city clerk approached me and told me she was sorry that it appeared i hadn t broken any laws as it turns out she was only using the sheriff as a prop she wanted to create a news story she wanted to say they had to call in a law enforcement officer to prevent me from intimidating the voters when we left for lunch she called the press the story was printed with no opposition to their lies and we were never contacted to give our side the gop party told us to leave after lunch they said the press was there and they didn t want us to talk to them we reluctantly left after our second time at the same polls and not seeing any real improvement i decided i needed to demand someone from the secretary of state s office speak to me i called ruth johnson s office and i was directed to her assistant linda lee tarver who for the record is a lovely woman and i do believe she was genuinely concerned about our situation i spent over an hour on the phone with linda lee tarver explaining in great detail all that took place on that day she said she was stunned and that i should tell everything to secretary of state ruth johnson s chief of staff mike seneyko i then spoke with mike on the phone for over an hour he promised they would do something i never heard back from him to this day i have yet to hear back from a single gop official apparently two mothers who risked their safety and possibly our lives to protect the sanctity of the vote was not important enough to them will we be poll challenger again you betcha just knowing that we possibly slowed the bleed a bit makes me feel like it was all worth it do i trust the gop to take voter fraud by democrats seriously hell

              " 'nyt s gifts america with christmas eve letter from black professor who teaches students every white person is a racist video it doesn t matter if you have black friends if you voted for barack obama or even if you re married to a black person you re still a racist you can essentially never escape your white privilege and hate for blacks no matter what dreams a black person may have the white person is going to take them away from you in 2015 i conducted a series of 19 interviews with philosophers and public intellectuals on the issue of race my aim was to engage in this very public space with the often unnamed elephant in the room these discussions helped me and i hope many of our readers to better understand how race continues to function in painful ways within our country that was one part of a gift that i wanted to give to readers of the stone the larger philosophical community and the world that is how i want to deliver my own message now dear white america i have a weighty request as you read this letter i want you to listen with love a sort of love that demands that you look at parts of yourself that might cause pain and terror as james baldwin would say did you hear that you may have missed it i repeat i want you to listen with love well at least try we don t talk much about the urgency of love these days especially within the public sphere much of our discourse these days is about revenge name calling hate and divisiveness i have yet to hear it from our presidential hopefuls or our political pundits i don t mean the hollywood type of love but the scary kind the kind that risks not being reciprocated the kind that refuses to flee in the face of danger to make it a bit easier for you i ve decided to model as best as i can what i m asking of you let me demonstrate the vulnerability that i wish you to show as a child of socrates james baldwin and audre lorde let me speak the truth refuse to err on the side of caution this letter is a gift for you bear in mind though that some gifts can be heavy to bear you don t have to accept it there is no obligation i give it freely believing that many of you will throw the gift back in my face saying that i wrongly accuse you that i am too sensitive that i m a race hustler and that i blame white people you for everything i have read many of your comments i have even received some hate mail in this letter i ask you to look deep to look into your souls with silence to quiet that voice that will speak to you of your white innocence so as you read this letter take a deep breath make a space for my voice in the deepest part of your psyche try to listen to practice being silent there are times when you must quiet your own voice to hear from or about those who suffer in ways that you do not what if i told you that i m sexist well i am yes i said it and i mean just that i have watched my male students squirm in their seats when i ve asked them to identify and talk about their sexism there are few men i suspect who would say that they are sexists and even fewer would admit that their sexism actually oppresses women certainly not publicly as i ve just done no taking it back now to make things worse i m an academic a philosopher i m supposed to be one of the enlightened ones surely we are beyond being sexists some who may genuinely care about my career will say that i m being too risky that i am jeopardizing my academic livelihood some might even say that as a black male who has already been stereotyped as a crotch grabbing sexual fiend that i m at risk of reinforcing that stereotype let s be real that racist stereotype has been around for centuries it is already part of white america s imaginary landscape yet i refuse to remain a prisoner of the lies that we men like to tell ourselves that we are beyond the messiness of sexism and male patriarchy that we don t oppress women let me clarify this doesn t mean that i intentionally hate women or that i desire to oppress them it means that despite my best intentions i perpetuate sexism every day of my life please don t take this as a confession for which i m seeking forgiveness confessions can be easy especially when we know that forgiveness is immediately forthcoming as a sexist i have failed women i have failed to speak out when i should have i have failed to engage critically and extensively their pain and suffering in my writing i have failed to transcend the rigidity of gender roles in my own life i have failed to challenge those poisonous assumptions that women are inferior to men or to speak out loudly in the company of male philosophers who believe that feminist philosophy is just a nonphilosophical fad i have been complicit with and have allowed myself to be seduced by a country that makes billions of dollars from sexually objectifying women from pornography commercials video games to hollywood movies i am not innocent i have been fed a poisonous diet of images that fragment women into mere body parts i have also been complicit with a dominant male narrative that says that women enjoy being treated like sexual toys in our collective male imagination women are things to be used for our visual and physical titillation and even as i know how poisonous and false these sexist assumptions are i am often ambushed by my own hidden sexism i continue to see women through the male gaze that belies my best intentions not to sexually objectify them our collective male erotic feelings and fantasies are complicit in the degradation of women and we must be mindful that not all women endure sexual degradation in the same way i recognize how my being a sexist has a differential impact on black women and women of color who are not only victims of racism but also sexism my sexism for example black women and women of color not only suffer from sexual objectification but the ways in which they are objectified is linked to how they are racially depicted some as exotic and others as hyper sexual you see the complicity the responsibility the pain that i cause runs deep and get this i refuse to seek shelter i refuse to live a lie so every day of my life i fight against the dominant male narrative choosing to see women as subjects not objects but even as i fight there are moments of failure just because i fight against sexism does not give me clean hands as it were at the end of the day i continue to falter and i continue to oppress and even though the ways in which i oppress women is unintentional this does not free me of being responsible if you are white and you are reading this letter i ask that you don t run to seek shelter from your own racism don t hide from your responsibility rather begin right now to practice being vulnerable being neither a good white person nor a liberal white person will get you off the proverbial hook i consider myself to be a decent human being yet i m sexist take another deep breath i ask that you try to be un sutured if that term brings to mind a state of pain open flesh it is meant to do so after all it is painful to let go of your white innocence to use this letter as a mirror one that refuses to show you what you want to see one that demands that you look at the lies that you tell yourself so that you don t feel the weight of responsibility for those who live under the yoke of whiteness your whiteness i can see your anger i can see that this letter is being misunderstood this letter is not asking you to feel bad about yourself to wallow in guilt that is too easy i m asking for you to tarry to linger with the ways in which you perpetuate a racist society the ways in which you are racist i m now daring you to face a racist history which paraphrasing baldwin has placed you where you are and that has formed your own racism again in the spirit of baldwin i am asking you to enter into battle with your white self i m asking that you open yourself up to speak to to admit to the racist poison that is inside of you again take a deep breath don t tell me about how many black friends you have don t tell me that you are married to someone of color don t tell me that you voted for obama don t tell me that i m the racist don t tell me that you don t see color don t tell me that i m blaming whites for everything to do so is to hide yet again you may have never used the n word in your life you may hate the k k k but that does not mean that you don t harbor racism and benefit from racism after all you are part of a system that allows you to walk into stores where you are not followed where you get to go for a bank loan and your skin does not count against you where you don t need to engage in the talk that black people and people of color must tell their children when they are confronted by white police officers as you reap comfort from being white we suffer for being black and people of color but your comfort is linked to our pain and suffering just as my comfort in being male is linked to the suffering of women which makes me sexist so too you are racist that is the gift that i want you to accept to embrace it is a form of knowledge that is taboo imagine the impact that the acceptance of this gift might have on you and the world take another deep breath i know that there are those who will write to me in the comment section with boiling anger sarcasm disbelief denial there are those who will say yancy is just an angry black man there are others who will say why isn t yancy telling black people to be honest about the violence in their own black neighborhoods or how can yancy say that all white people are racists if you are saying these things then you ve already failed to listen i come with a gift you re already rejecting the gift that i have to offer this letter is about you don t change the conversation i assure you that so many black people suffering from poverty and joblessness which is linked to high levels of crime are painfully aware of the existential toll that they have had to face because they are black and as baldwin adds for no other reason some of your white brothers and sisters have made this leap the legal scholar stephanie m wildman has written i simply believe that no matter how hard i work at not being racist i still am because part of racism is systemic i benefit from the privilege that i am struggling to see and the journalism professor robert jensen i like to think i have changed even though i routinely trip over the lingering effects of that internalized racism and the institutional racism around me every time i walk into a store at the same time as a black man and the security guard follows him and leaves me alone to shop i am benefiting from white privilege what i m asking is that you first accept the racism within yourself accept all of the truth about what it means for you to be white in a society that was created for you i m asking for you to trace the binds that tie you to forms of domination that you would rather not see when you walk into the world you can walk with assurance you have already signed a contract so to speak that guarantees you a certain form of social safety baldwin argues for a form of love that is a state of being or state of grace not in the infantile american sense of being made happy but in the tough and universal sense of quest and daring and growth most of my days i m engaged in a personal and societal battle against sexism so many times i fail and so many times i m complicit but i refuse to hide behind that mirror that lies to me about my non sexist nobility baldwin says love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within in my heart i m done with the mask of sexism though i m tempted every day to wear it and there are times when it still gets the better of me white america are you prepared to be at war with yourself your white identity your white power your white privilege are you prepared to show me a white self that love has unmasked i m asking for love in return for a gift in fact i m hoping that this gift might help you to see yourself in ways that you have not seen before of course the history of white supremacy in america belies this gesture of black gift giving this gesture of non sentimental love martin luther king jr was murdered even as he loved perhaps the language of this letter will encourage a split not a split between black and white but a fissure in your understanding a space for loving a trayvon martin eric garner tamir rice aiyana jones sandra bland laquan mcdonald and others i m suggesting a form of love that enables you to see the role that you play even despite your anti racist actions in a system that continues to value black lives on the cheap take one more deep breath i have another gift if you have young children before you fall off to sleep tonight i want you to hold your child touch your child s face smell your child s hair count the fingers on your child s hand see the miracle that is your child and then with as much vision as you can muster i want you to imagine that your child is black in peace george yancyvia nyt shere is a dreadfully long interview of professor george yancy who drones on and on about how white people can never escape their racism it s especially interesting to hear the interviewer tell professor yancy that young white people buy into the idea that there is no racism but they just don t know the truth translation even if you re not a racist and have never seen a black friend be discriminated against you re still a racist go to 17 45 mark of the video to see this incredible exchange to be black is to already be dead which is a hell of a place to be they re socially dead because in a white world they re

policy of supporting an armed opposition in syria while certain officials have only recently admitted to arming and funding these militants evidence shows that the support has been pouring in through both covert means and official channels from the onset of the conflict we now know that those commonly referred to in the western media as rebels in syria are comprised mainly of religious extremists and designated terrorists despite this revelation the us uk france along with saudi arabia qatar and others have continued to back them and even go so far as to color them with political legitimacy all in a grand effort to try and achieve regime change in syria it s not the first time either that washington has pursued this same policy of destablization in order to overthrow a foreign government president donald trump has an opportunity to reverse this backwards us policy will he capitalize on the opportunity to start anew or will the us revert back to its old deep state default position the passage of hawaii congresswomen tulsi gabbard s recently proposed piece of legislation entitled stop arming terrorists act would be positive move in that direction will president trump champion her bill the following is an open letter from writer steven sahiounie to the us government to the government of the united states of america i am asking my american government to stop supporting terrorists in syria the us government and media keep calling them moderate rebels but they are not they were never moderate and many are not rebels by definition a rebel is rebelling against their own government however many of the us backed rebels are not syrian and have no family ties to syria and have never been a citizen of syria for example how could a chinese citizen fight in a rebellion against the american government by what right does a chinese citizen have to kill and maim in order to change the us government it is wrong and makes no sense i would never advocate or support any armed attack or rebellion against the american government there are laws against murdering raping kidnapping and maiming people in usa the same such laws exist in syria how could a democracy and a world leader like usa advocate murdering raping kidnapping and maiming innocent syrian people from the out set of violence and crimes in syria in 2011 the us backed rebels used sectarian slogans and carries out sectarian attacks and massacres syria is a secular form of government as is usa why would american leaders support the targeting of minorities in syria when the president of america is himself a minority why would the us government support the destruction on churches and mosques american s value religious freedom and equality of minorities yet the us backed free syrian army destroyed churches targeted christians attacked christian villages as well as targeting muslim minority sects with similar acts such as kessab ballouta mahardeh and maaloula among many others the us government sent weapons missiles special training equipment food medical supplies communications and satellite imagery to the free syrian army from 2011 to 2016 yet the current exodus of evacuees from east aleppo has not received even one loaf of bread from usa while the us backed fsa had many warehouses full of food and medicines they have left behind as they retreated deeper into east aleppo finally the rebels who agreed to vacate recently have burned all the medical supplies and food storages which were the gifts of the american taxpayers so as to prevent the distribution of those supplies to the starving masses who have fled east aleppo now american citizens are currently very concerned about syrian refugees coming to usa who may have had ties to terrorism the us backed rebels are exactly the type of people the american citizens should be afraid of as possible new neighbors living in their midst as settled refugees they are the type of people who would chop off the head of their neighbor because his religion is not exactly the same as theirs they are the type of people who are willing to take money from a foreign government for the purpose of destroying their own community they are the type of people who do not value religious freedom or minority rights what would happen when the us backed rebels who may be settled in usa decide to rebel against the american government will the us president and congress call them freedom fighters or perhaps america s enemies will fund and support their armed attacks on the us government and civilians we should all be

              " 'fake news the collapse of the msm s facebook russian bot storyas 21wire said last year the russian hacking or russiagate story was a political hoax from the start what this story can now demonstrate is that for the last 18 months the entire mainstream media has been promulgating a highly politicised and relentless campaign of fake news designed to implicate russia in an imaginary scandal leading the pack are former papers of record the new york times and the washington post flanked by america s premier broadcast tv propaganda outlet cnn last week we revealed how powerful politicians in washington had pressured facebook executives to come up with any evidence to support the democratic party s theory of russian meddling demonstrating clear collusion between the obama administration and silicon valley corporation facebook with the goal of fabricating a scandal in order to scapegoat vladimir putin and the russians for the electoral collapse of hillary clinton last november as a result us russian relations have been sacrificed at the altar of petty partisan politics and a failing deep state agenda it certainly begs the question with so much at stake why would washington and msm lie and risk pushing global tensions closer to a world war level confrontation if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about consortium news exclusive the u s mainstream media is determined to prove russia gate despite the scandal s cracking foundation and its inexplicable anomalies such as why russia would set up a facebook puppies page by robert parrywhat is perhaps most unprofessional unethical and even immoral about the u s mainstream media s coverage of russia gate is how all the stories start with the conclusion russia bad and then make whatever shards of information exist fit the preordained narrative for instance we re told that facebook executives who were sent back three times by democratic lawmakers to find something to pin on russia finally detected 100 000 worth of ads spread out over three years from accounts suspected of links to russia or similar hazy wording these facebook ads and 201 related twitter accounts we re told represent the long missing proof about russian meddling in the u s presidential election after earlier claims faltered or fell apart under even minimal scrutiny in the old days journalists might have expressed some concern that facebook found the ads only under extraordinary pressure from powerful politicians such as sen mark warner d virginia the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee and a leading legislator on the tech industry but today s mainstream reporters took warner s side and made it look like facebook had been dragging its heels and that there must be much more out there however it doesn t really seem to matter how little evidence there is anything will do even the paltry 100 000 is not put in any perspective facebook has annual revenue of 27 billion nor the 201 twitter accounts compared to twitter s 328 million monthly users nor are the hazy allegations of suspected links to russia subjected to serious inspection although russia is a nation of 144 million people and many divergent interests it s assumed that everything must be personally ordered by president vladimir putin yet if you look at some of the details about these 100 000 in ads you learn the case is even flimsier than you might have thought the sum was spread out over 2015 2016 and 2017 and thus represented a very tiny pebble in a very large lake of facebook activity but more recently we learned that only 44 percent of the ads appeared before americans went to the polls last november according to facebook that would mean that 56 percent appeared afterwards facebook added that roughly 25 of the ads were never shown to anyone for 50 of the ads less than 3 was spent for 99 of the ads less than 1 000 was spent so as miniscule as the 100 000 in ad buys over three years may have seemed the tiny pebble turns out really to be only a fraction of a tiny pebble if the russians indeed did toss it into the 2016 campaign what about the puppies we further have learned that most ads weren t for or against a specific candidate but rather addressed supposedly controversial issues that the mainstream media insists were meant to divide the united states and thus somehow undermine american democracy except it turns out that one of the issues was puppies as mike isaac and scott shane of the new york times reported in tuesday s editions the russians who posed as americans on facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises there was even a facebook group for animal lovers with memes of adorable puppies that spread across the site with the help of paid ads now there are a lot of controversial issues in america but i don t think any of us would put puppies near the top of the list isaac and shane reported that there were also supposedly russia linked groups advocating gay rights gun rights and black civil rights although precisely how these divergent groups were linked to russia or the kremlin was never fully explained facebook declined to offer details at this point a professional journalist might begin to pose some very hard questions to the sources who presumably include many partisan democrats and their political allies hyping the evil russia narrative it would be time for some lectures to the sources about the consequences for taking reporters on a wild ride in conspiracy land yet instead of starting to question the overall premise of this scandal journalists at the new york times the washington post cnn etc keep making excuses for the nuttiness the explanation for the puppy ads was that the nefarious russians might be probing to discover americans who might later be susceptible to propaganda the goal of the dog lovers page was more obscure isaac and shane acknowledged but some analysts suggested a possible motive to build a large following before gradually introducing political content without viewing the entire feed from the page now closed by facebook it is impossible to say whether the russian operators tried such tactics seriously this is what the new york times is passing off as journalism now the joe mccarthy of russia gatethe times then turned to clinton watts a former fbi agent and a top promoter of the

arifleischer january 6 2017another known wolf as 21 wire has documented over the years many so called shooting terror attacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place a place where a lone wolf graduates into the ranks of a known wolf in fact very often those being watched by authorities exhibit all the tell tale signs of a patsy or an informant working either for a law enforcement or intelligence agency historically government operators have often made use of low life criminals and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various role in entrapment stings or sometimes as bonafide actors in an actual attacks in any case alleged attackers and security agencies have a dicey relationship making any link between them highly suspect in nature in january of 2015 a strategic security service think tank known as the soufan group reported that a larger national security threat resides with radicals who ve had a lengthy criminal background with known ties to security agencies the soufan group a new york think tank said a better term for lone wolves would be known wolves given how many are already known to western intelligence agencies before they strike these individuals acting alone or in small groups have been on the radar of various agencies and organisations highlighting the difficulty of effectively monitoring and managing people at the nexus of criminality and terrorism it said in a report this week the fort lauderdale shooting story rapidly emerged out of corporate media halls looking to sell the public on the latest tragic shooting in america the hollywood international airport shooting has elements of other high profile shooting events in recent history such as the tsa lax shooting the the tucson shooting orlando pulse nightclub shooting the san bernardino shooting attack the chattanooga military base shooting siege as well as the aspects of the aurora theater shooting and the grand theater shooting in lafayette and many others is the fort lauderdale airport shooter another case of a known wolf triggered into action the apparent fort lauderdale airport shooter santiago ruiz who is said to be puerto rican was born in new jersey living in alaska and was well known to authorities having recently undergone a mental health evaluation after allegedly visiting an fbi office in alaska where he claimed he was under cia mind control with voices in his head telling him to join isis they say last november he walked into the fbi s office in anchorage alaska claiming that his mind was being controlled by the cia and that it was forcing him to join isis he appeared agitated and incoherent and made disjointed statements and although he said he didn t wish to hurt anyone agents were concerned by his erratic behavior and decided to call local authorities a senior federal law enforcement official said local police took him to a local medical facility for evaluation and the fbi closed its assessment of santiago after conducting database reviews interagency checks and interviews with family members the official said new in nov 2016 fll suspect walked into fbi office in anchorage claiming he was being forced to fight for isis sources tell cbs news cbs news cbsnews january 6 2017shades of the manchurian candidate we re also told that the suspect s aunt had flagged his mentally unstable condition previously according to usa today yet the troubling episode is now part of an emerging profile of a deeply disturbed man described by his aunt friday as someone who had lost his mind maria luisa ruiz of union city n j said her nephew who had moved to alaska for work as a security guard only recently began to show signs of instability like a month ago it was like he lost his mind she said he said he saw things the inclusion of santiago ruiz s alleged voices in his head supposedly triggered by the cia immediately recalls another bizarre case that was also difficult to comprehend the navy yard shooter from 2013 here s a passage from a 21wire report discussing the apparent navy yard shooter aaron alexis rather than get caught up in the fear campaigns sold to us by our favorite news anchor zombies its important to consider another aspect of these mass shootings by making a tally of the trigger points that media uses to manipulate public perception as they carefully propagandize certain elements within a crisis making sure to illicit the right reaction from every major demographic is this what we are seeing in the aftermath of the fort lauderdale shooting heavy com added the following details about the supposedly troubled santiago ruiz the shooter whose troubled behavior had already drawn the attention of the fbi army and anchorage police arrived friday afternoon at the busy airport on a flight from alaska with the gun used in the shooting properly stored in his checked baggage nbc news reports one report said the shooter who lived in alaska had no other luggage but the gun which federal rules allow a person to declare at a ticket counter and check under the plane but not carry on in addition to santiago ruiz s lengthy time with the us military and the national guard in recent years the suspected shooter was involved in various crimes here s a passage from the daily beast describing some of santiago s background according to charging documents provided by the anchorage prosecutor s office to the daily beast on january 10 2016 santiago verbally assaulted his then girlfriend a 40 year old mother of one child from a previous marriage whom the daily beast is not naming through a locked bathroom door telling her to get the fuck out bitch after he forced his way in by breaking down the door he smacked her in the head and strangled her by the time police arrived santiago had fled the scene santiago was arrested days later and released on the condition that he have no contact with the victim but in february anchorage police found him at his girlfriend s residence and he was charged for violating the conditions of his release that case is still pending alaska court records show a criminal record under santiago s name for minor traffic infractions including operating a vehicle without insurance and a broken taillight records also show his landlord evicted him for non payment of rent in february 2015 the assault case was resolved in march when santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement an alternative to adjudication where prosecutors agreed to dismiss the charges in exchange for esteban s completion of requirements the details of which are unknown while anchorage municipal prosecutor seneca theno told the daily beast that previous charges against santiago ruiz are unlikely to be dropped following the airport shooting you still have to wonder what requirements were asked of santiago ruiz to get the alleged assault charges dropped from his record in the first place given the brutal nature of them fox news echoes a sun sentinel report why the gunman may have chosen south florida was unclear he had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the naples area a two hour drive away the sun sentinel reported the same fox report adds the following about santiago ruiz s alleged lengthy mental health battle bryan santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues we have not talked for the past three weeks bryan santiago said that s a bit unusual i m in shock he was a serious person he was a normal person mass shooting distraction another aspect to these highly emotive and polarizing known wolf shooting events is that usually they dominate us media coverage for several days as other charged elements of an alleged shooter attacker are propagandized such as santiago ruiz s palestinian scarf image seen on the left seized upon by fox news anchors who fused santiago ruiz s allegedly isis like hand gesture with the gaza israeli conflict the shocking scene at fort lauderdale s hollywood international airport occurred the same exact day us intelligence leaders briefed president elect donald trump on so called russian hack allegations in the lead up to the 2016 election back in september of 2016 while examining the aftermath of the new york and new jersey bomb plot attack we analyzed whether a deeper social engineering agenda might have been at play as part of a larger geopolitical drama unfolded in syria appeared to be masked by media when looking deeper we discovered other overlapping stories that coincided alongside the known wolf nyc bomber here s a passage that discussed the nyc attack that seemed to bury western coverage regarding a vicious airstrike campaign that killed dozens of members of syria s army you have to wonder were the events in new york and new jersey also a weapon of mass distraction following a major international embarrassment for the united states both at home and abroad the brutal airstrike campaign in syria that killed over 70 syrian troops this unlikely bombing incident just happened to also coincide with the un general assembly in nyc where president obama was delivering among other speeches his war on terror addresses to the international community no surprise then with the city suddenly on high terror alert that obama quickly confidently and comfortably used his center stage spotlight at the un shifting into national security mode boasting how quickly his police forces solved the case it was almost if he was ready for events that weekend similarly you have to consider if this new high profile shooting event at fort lauderdale s hollywood international airport will dominate the news cycle as the us intelligence community scrambles to prove russian hack allegations over the next week on january 4th abc news reported the following the classified report requested by president barack obama detailing russia s alleged role in cyberattacks during u s presidential elections dating back to 2008 is now complete and he is expected to receive the first briefing on its findings on thursday afternoon u s officials tell abc news president elect donald trump who said last week he would receive his briefing on the matter on tuesday or wednesday of this week is scheduled to receive his briefing on friday both briefings will be conducted by the heads of relevant agencies including the office of the director of national intelligence the national security agency the fbi and the cia u s officials denied claims from trump that his special briefing was delayed so the u s intelligence community could strengthen its case against russia officials instead said there may have been a scheduling disconnect or some confusion on the part of the trump transition team interestingly other explosive high profile stories went to the back burner such as the chicago kidnapping and teen torture story and the fallout from cnn s don lemon following his egregious comments after the tragic racially motivated attack media memory reports of a second shooter at terminal 1during the later hours of the us mainstream media coverage networks like cnn were still floating the possibility of a second shooter as reports emerged of shots fired in the adjacent terminal housing united airlines terminal 1 interestingly local reports also reported eye witness accounts of a second gunman involved in the fort lauderdale shooting here s a passage from an abc news affiliate discussing the reports of a second gunman at the fort lauderdale shooting all day i ve heard people talking about second incidences catie rutledge wrote on instagram after waiting on the tarmac for hours and hunting someone down to get our bags we are now waiting for a bus so that we can leave the airport there was panic when authorities feared there was a second gunman law enforcement asked travelers to seek shelter fear prompted many to say their final good byes to loved ones some frightened parents were in tears as they tried to protect their children this aspect of the case seemingly disappeared from media outlets following santiago ruiz s arrest the phenomena of multiple shooters being immediately reported after an apparent mass shooting event was also echoed during both the orlando nightclub shooting and the san bernardino attack in 2015 later in the evening broward county sheriff scott israel confirmed that there was no second shooter despite previous reports the suspect was being interrogated by the fbi this statement was in stark contrast to multiple witness statements made on national tv placing the series of shots or perhaps an additional series of shots and subsequent crowds fleeing in panic at terminal 1 that would either be instead of terminal 2 or in addition to it this wasn t just an anomaly this was backed up by at least 2 different witnesses on cnn perhaps more in other reports which 21wire has yet to collate here was this a case of something that happened in terminal 1 either part of a drill or another gunman which was memory holed by the media and dhs or could this be we are looking at planted witnesses who got their lines wrong this is a fair question to ask considering we are talking about multiple witnesses stating the shots and crowds panicking in terminals other than the official story in terminal 2 here are four alternative witnesses witness 1 cnn s coverage of the active shooter festival at fort lauderdale airport reveals yet another anomaly in their story cnn reported the alleged shooter esteban santiago shot 5 people dead in the delta terminal 2 and yet all the witnesses reported 4 shots fired in the united terminal 1 when this witness a father who flew in from chicago tells of the united t1 shots fired cnn s reporter boris sanchez appears to panic possibly then receiving a feed in his ear and then essentially tells the witness you are wrong there were no shots fired in united terminal 1 was this bad reporting or bad stage management by cnn watch witness 2 immediately after cnn s boris sanchez mix up with man flying in from chicago at united terminal 1 another cnn witness was suddenly produced going by the name of ryan ward interviewed by jim sciutto then comes on using very scripted language apparently in an attempt to clean up the inconsistent statements of the last witness ryan ward describes the mayhem people running luggage flying and people screaming gunman coming even though he admits he was not in delta terminal 2 where police report the actual shooting took place ward claims he was in a wheel chair because of back surgery but then claims he got up and ran over to save a little girl and i ran back over and pushed the mom into a corner and laid on top of her he then says that it does sound like it was an unsubstantiated second threat but people certainly weren t acting like it here he was mirroring the identical language used by the previous cnn reporters coincidence even more oddly ward claims he was flying jet blue and that the jet blue staff were really great only problem is that jet blue is in terminal 3 and not in t1 or t2 watch witness 3 another witness testifying multiple gunman on the scene although the terminal location being referenced by this 3rd witness is somewhat unclear also there is an additional media report by intellihub of a pilot in uniform and on site who also testifies about a loud commotion with police in pursuit of a perpetrator seen in terminal 1 a stark contrast to the official story the pilot believes that there was another shooting in terminal 1 that law enforcement and the f b i are likely covering up i could hear females screaming and people running away from terminal 1 the pilot said he feels that it was definitely some kind of combined effort to attack the airport in addition to that here is a fifth witness seen in this unconfirmed cell phone video from a female passenger out on the airport tarmac apparently from terminal 1 and referencing a second shooter event located after the tsa barrier which seems to be a different location to the baggage check area editors note if readers have any other witness reports of a second shooter or shots fired in terminal 2 please leave them below in the comment section here s an abc news feature with mark lea an apparent eye witness later photographed the crime scene who came face to face with santiago ruiz who also rather incredibly managed to not get shot during the encounter fort lauderdale s active shooter drillsvery often preceding an apparent shooting attack there is the presence of mass casualty drills fort lauderdale was no exception in 2015 the sun sentinel reported the following at a fort lauderdale cinema wednesday two men in camouflage gear calmly walked down the aisle and fired rifles and handguns at moviegoers twenty seven volunteers were injured in three theaters during the drill fort lauderdale police guarded and escorted paramedics wearing protective gear to tend to the wounded actors even though the shooters weren t captured and blank gunfire echoed elsewhere in the riverwalk movie complex the agencies goal is to speed up paramedics responses during mass killings domestic calls and other violent incidents similarly in june of 2016 an inter agency meeting described future protocols regarding mass drills the meeting held every quarter is an opportunity for agencies to coordinate with one another and discuss the latest techniques in fighting domestic terror attacks last month agencies participated in an active shooter exercise at the fort lauderdale postal facility in february the group participated in operation heat shield consisting of weapons of mass destruction and an active shooting drill sheriff scott israel of broward county sheriff s office and sheriff rick bradshaw of palm beach county sheriff s office said these training exercises are important with such a large law enforcement effort to tackle the active shooter you have to wonder why and how these events seem to coincide with major attacks on us soil here s a youtube video from commentator peekay truth discussing aspects of this latest mass shooting tragedy in america informants and pawnsadditionally as we ve mentioned before during the aftermath of 2014 s canadian parliament shooting in ottawa we outlined many of the primary markers used in certain terror related events globally and other mass casualty incidents often seen in america the shocking event like other bizarre attacks in recent years have often distorted public opinion pushing the populace towards new security measures in the wake of heavily coordinated and stylized crimes the suspected parliament hill and national war memorial shooter

bibeau was already designated as a high risk traveller by the canadian government s security services who had also seized his passport was this the reason why the zehaf bibeau snapped was he being

terror sleeper cells hiding in a nation near you none of them acknowledge the historical fact that they themselves have also helped to harbor grow foment and radicalize individuals through counter terrorism operations for decades it is important to mention again that the fbi created the counter intelligence program cointelpro to influence and disrupt political factions from the inside out between 1956 and 1971 including the socialist workers party in 1973 the fbi s controversial program infiltrated and radicalized hundreds of left wing and right wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across america as we stated after the suspicious oregon campus shooting in 2015 mass media has worked out their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of any tragic event as they have with many others incidents the fort lauderdale shooting appears once again to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready made laundry list of items in this case mental health supported by online rants on social media about the persona of a shooter as an ironclad motive for a crime the aftermath in the case of fort lauderdale is no different as it rapidly descended into an overindulgent barrage of media speculation and theorizing all too often we ve seen the stage persona of any alleged attacker or killer being touted as hard evidence despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis and debate potentially without a definitive conclusion even if the evidence reaches a court room for the average person it s hard to differentiate from a drill or a real event causing one to scrutinize the legitimacy of such an operation in recent years the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies have come into question none perhaps more dubious than the newburgh fbi sting that involved entrapping four men to participate in a fabricated event created by the bureau here s a 2011 passage from the guardian describing how an fbi informant named shahed hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot the newburgh four now languish in jail hussain does not for hussain was a fake in fact hussain worked for the fbi as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals yet far from being active militants the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with newburgh s grim epidemic of crack drug crime and poverty one had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine he also believed florida was a foreign country hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot including 250 000 to one man and free holidays and expensive cars as defence lawyers poured through the evidence the newburgh four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial fbi policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets there has been no case as egregious as this it is unique in the incentive the government provided a quarter million dollars said professor karen greenberg a terrorism expert at fordham university the whole episode seemed akin to the wtc 1993 bombing case which involved yet another informant working alongside officials the gun control security agendaas pointed out in 21wire during 2015 s oregon campus shooting the primary focus for mass media concerning the fort lauderdale incident will now be all of the hot button socio political issues including gun control reform and those concerned over mental illness background checks along with those who constitutionally oppose such restrictive legislation it should be obvious by now that events like fort lauderdale along with other mass shootings have become a sharp catalyst to usher in calls for endless new mass shooting protocols inter agency fusion first responder emergency medical protocols and also for injecting more and more military terminology into civilian life with the media playing a critical role in steering the public away from questioning any of the dubious elements surrounding any shooting event in a sense the media is helping to nudge these shooting events out of the forensic sphere and into the political arena as quickly as possible effectively closing the feedback loop of concerned citizens and those who may have been affected by an event the fort lauderdale shooting has prompted the mainstream media to feed into concerns over airport security gun ownership and a persons mental health background all of media s fear inducing

cope with a 45 percent poverty rate among its 3 5 million u s citizens in addition it is reeling from a zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry language allowing puerto rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent known as a cram down remains the bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders but the language remains muddied one analyst surmised tonight

statement for a link to a factbox on the bill click while both republican and democratic leaders of the u s house of representatives welcomed the bill after several delays how more conservative

shows that donald j trump the republican nominee for president would win the election if it were held monday and the polls are correct it takes 270 electoral votes to win the election with the exception of two states maine and nebraska the winner of a state wins that state s electoral votes on election day in the general election the reliably red republican states alaska idaho utah montana north dakota south dakota wyoming nebraska kansas oklahoma texas louisiana arkansas missouri indiana mississippi kentucky alabama tennessee west virginia and south carolina are all expected to easily vote for trump for president that totals 164 electoral votes despite initial polling scares during the darkest days of trump s campaign in also reliably red georgia and arizona both of those states per recent polling have seemingly moved solidly into the trump column that s another 27 electoral votes for a total of 191 electoral votes with the other red states from there add in florida with 29 electoral votes most recent polling out of florida with a couple rare exceptions has shown trump with a slight or modest lead one outlier poll from monmouth drags the realclearpolitics polling average in the four way race between trump democratic nominee hillary rodham clinton green party nominee jill stein and libertarian gary johnson down to a 0 1 percent trump advantage in the sunshine state but the billionaire real estate mogul leads in four out of the last seven surveys and the only other two where clinton has any lead it is inside the margin of error trump has had a comfortable cushion in florida since labor day and in the last poll conducted partially before it he tied clinton assuming trump can lock down florida and its 29 electoral votes that he will need to win the white house and add that to the rest he already has he then hits 220 electoral votes move from there out to nevada and iowa for a total of 12 more electoral votes six per each state in the three way race in nevada stein is not on the ballot in the silver state trump has led in every poll in september according to realclearpolitics during the course of the month the man whose name is emblazoned across the top of a golden building just off las vegas boulevard has steadily increased his lead from just a point in the first september poll by nbc news the wall street journal and marist to two points in a monmouth poll a week later to three points in the latest two surveys from fox news and ktnv rasmussen his polling average is a 2 3 percent advantage over clinton it is so bad for clinton in nevada right now that even politico ran a headline saying the state is giving democrats heartburn iowa is the battleground state where trump is most comfortable right now trump has had a comfortable lead in all three iowa polls this month from emerson monmouth and quinnipiac and the realclearpolitics polling average currently gives trump a 6 3 percent advantage in the hawkeye state walking into the debate fit iowa and nevada in the trump column and he is up to 232 electoral votes next up is maine s second congressional district maine is one of those two funky states that splits its electoral votes by congressional district nebraska which is solidly in trump s column is the other and trump is polling significantly ahead of clinton there the only three public surveys done in maine s second district all of which were done in september give trump massive leads outside their margins of error the first by emerson showed trump with a five point lead over clinton at the beginning of the month in a four way race a second poll from colby college surveyusa done mostly after labor day gave trump a ten point lead and that finding was confirmed by a later poll from mprc a progressive group that had trump up 11 points in maine s second district he was also trending upward statewide and in the realclearpolitics average statewide only trails clinton by 3 8 points but for now let s just give trump the place that s firmly in his column the second district and that is just one electoral vote with that picture he is at 233 total electoral votes north carolina another state where stein is not on

the tar heel state trump has been leading or the two were tied in every three way race poll since a quinnipiac poll conducted partially in august and partially in september was released realclearpolitics has trump s polling average at a 1 8 percent advantage over clinton in north carolina but his most recent poll from fox news put him at a five point lead there if trump locks down north carolina s 15 electoral votes on top of everything aforementioned that puts him at 248 total and in striking distance of the presidency this brings us to the all important state of ohio the

should be magnified because it happened at the hands of law enforcement officers the state given all that has happened over the last few days with the black lives matter movement i thought it would be a good idea for hillary to pen an op ed discussing the pain people feel as parents at the loss of their children to these incidents of police brutality how as a parent she knows that pain is magnified because it happens at the hands of the state and her commitment to solve the problem as president given her strong words on charlotte it could serve as a reminder that she gets it that racism isn t

much of their successful careers to harvey weinstein wait until their reputations were on the line to speak out about the sexual predator but they waited until only days before their new movie suburbicon is about to debut to say that they actually knew more about the abuse women received at the hands of the bully movie mogul than they had previously admitted to notably absent in the interview is the third actor ben affleck who completes the trio of bestie actors after affleck spoke out on the harvey weinstein controversy he was also accused of covering up weinstein s behavior as well as videos that show affleck used his power to prey on innocent women notice how quickly damon throws affleck under the bus saying he knew but only told damon who of course never told anyone else

views as theirs are left with only one option boycottsuburbicon and boycotthollywood in the interview that aired on monday morning george clooney and matt damon said that they knew weinstein was a bully and womanizer who bragged of bedding actresses but had no idea about the level of criminal behavior that was occurring behind closed doors in hotels damon also confessed that he was aware weinstein had sexually harassed the first lady of miramax gwyneth paltrow just before the actress shot the 1996 film adaptation of jane austen s emma for the studio i knew the story about gwyneth from ben affleck because he was with her after brad pitt and so i knew that story said damon but i was working with gwyneth and with harvey on the 1999 film the talented mr ripley he then added i never talked to gwyneth about it but ben told me that whatever or agreement they had come to there was an understanding and he treated her incredibly respectfully always affleck and pitt have not spoken about the incident and damon s revelation that he learned about weinstein s behavior from his friend may cause even more problems for the embattled actor as it seems to contradict his initial statement i am saddened and angry that a man who i worked with used his position of power to intimidate sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades said affleck almost one week after news of the scandal broke in a carefully worded response that seemed to suggest he had never before heard any of the allegations damon s decision to characterize the relationship between paltrow and weinstein as always respectful is a bit odd as well considering her admission that she had been sexually harassed by the mogul is part of the reason the men were sitting down for the interview clooney meanwhile said that like many of weinstein s victims he had been told a number of times by the mogul that he was bedding a number of stars harvey would talk to me about women that he had had affairs with said clooney i didn t necessarily believe him quite honestly because to believe him would be to believe the worst of some actresses who were friends of mine and i didn t really think that they had affairs with harvey and clearly they didn t he then added but the idea that this predator this assaulter was out there silencing women like that it s beyond infuriating and the fact that the story is coming out now and the more it comes out i want to know all of it daily mailwatch as these two actors desperately attempt to save their upcoming movie suburbicon as well as their hollywood careers he didn t do it out in the open matt damon on harvey weinstein pic twitter com oj1xeptapz good morning america gma october 23 2017 it s indefensible that s the only word you can start with harvey s admitted to it and it s indefensible i ve known harvey for 20 years he gave me my first big break as an actor in films on from dusk till dawn he gave me my first big break as a director with confessions of a dangerous mind we ve had dinners we ve been on location together we ve had arguments but i can tell you that i ve never seen any of this behavior ever i ve heard rumors and the rumors in general started back in the 90s and they were that certain actresses had slept with harvey to get a role it seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn t get the jobs based on their talent so i took those rumors with a grain of salt but the other part of this the part we re hearing now about eight women being paid off i didn t hear anything about that and i don t know anyone that did that s a whole other level and there s no way you can reconcile that there s nothing to say except that it s indefensible a lot of people are doing the you had to know thing right now and yes if you re asking if i knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young beautiful women sure but i had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight women for their silence and that these women were threatened and victimized i ve been talking with a lot of people about this and i don t know many people who knew of that there s an argument that everyone is complicit in it i suppose the argument would be that it s not just about hollywood but about all of us that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don t speak up you re complicit and there s no question about that',\n",

impose direct rule after the region s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if madrid refused to hold talks in an act unprecedented since spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s prime minister mariano rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on saturday that could trigger the move the socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time catalan president carles puigdemont ignoring a 10 a m deadline to drop his secession campaign wrote a letter to rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence the war of words increased uncertainty over a standoff that has raised fears of social unrest cut growth prospects for the euro zone s fourth largest economy and rattled the euro if the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression the catalan parliament could proceed if it is considered opportune to vote on a formal declaration of independence puigdemont said catalonia which has a distinctive culture and language triggered spain s biggest political crisis for decades with a secession bid it put to a referendum on oct 1 only 43 percent of voters participated but those who did voted overwhelmingly to secede while opponents of secession mostly stayed home spanish courts have ruled the referendum illegal but puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed the european union declined to help mediate saying the crisis was for madrid and barcelona to resolve member states are clear there is no room or space for any kind of mediation european council president donald tusk told a news conference during an eu leaders summit in brussels the regional authorities have not made clear how and when a declaration of independence would take place and whether it would be endorsed by the regional assembly some pro independence lawmakers have said they want to hold a vote in the catalan parliament to lend it a more solemn character rajoy plans to invoke article 155 of the 1978 constitution which allows taking control of a region if it breaks the law a senior government source said the exact measures would be agreed on saturday and probably voted through the upper house senate on oct 30 giving the secessionists a few days of leeway to respond before madrid takes control the regional authorities could use that time to split unilaterally call elections in the hope of strengthening their mandate or back down although this is seen as highly unlikely from the moment the measures are known the regional government knows what s going to happen and has a period of time to act until 155 can be acted upon the source said spanish stocks bonds and the euro all suffered in early trade but recovered a bounce some strategists attributed to a sense that madrid had the upper hand in the standoff the terms of article 155 are vague and could spur more wrangling with the restive region the government will use all the tools available to restore as soon as possible the law and the constitutional order recover peaceful cohabitation between citizens and stop the economic damage that the legal uncertainty is creating government spokesman inigo mendez de vigo said in a statement rajoy s team met members of the socialist party to coordinate their next steps a spokesman for the socialists said while they fully stood behind the government they would insist article 155 is applied in the most proportionate way madrid s options range from closing down the regional parliament and expelling lawmakers to a softer and more targeted approach the government source said theoretically the central administration could take control of the region s finances and police and call a snap election but some members of the catalan government have already questioned this interpretation of the constitution suggesting the stand off could extend for at least several more days carles riera a lawmaker from the pro independence cup party whose 10 deputies are vital to puigdemont s coalition said dialogue with the spanish state now looked impossible and called on the leader to formalize a declaration of independence from our point of view the sooner this happens the better riera told reuters in the catalan capital barcelona impatience is also setting in among residents of the port city merche 55 who voted for secession in the referendum said she was tired of the political to and fro people want a resolution go for one thing or the other but leave people in peace to carry on with their routine and their work she said rearranging lettuces on her market stall puigdemont has already defied rajoy once this week when he ignored a first deadline to drop the independence campaign and instead called for talks rajoy says the catalan government has repeatedly broken the law including when it held the banned referendum and when it made a symbolic declaration of independence on oct 10 only to suspend it seconds later puigdemont says a violent police crackdown during the referendum and arrests of pro independence leaders on charges of sedition show the spanish state has become authoritarian',\n",

              " '10 reasons a vote recount is a really bad idea for americawatch jill stein explain why she s working to force a recount in 3 states that used to be democrat strongholds ms stein starts in her answers during the cnn interview in the video above why would anyone not want to count the votes and to be sure that they were counted accurately what we know is that there were lots of hacks taking place around this election much of the equipment used is not only open to hacks it basically invites hacks and malfeasance tampering human error etc here are 10 reasons this is a horrible idea 1 the votes were counted with integrity the real experts do not believe a recount is needed as described by the detroit free press the report says the scientists believe they have identified a questionable trend of clinton performing worse in wisconsin counties that relied on electronic voting machines compared to paper ballots and optical scanners it wasn t clear from the reports why michigan and pennsylvania were reportedly cited by the scientists chris thomas the longtime director of michigan s bureau of elections said michigan doesn t use the electronic voting machines identified in the report as being the sources of potential hacking we are an entire paper and optical scan state thomas told the free presswednesday nothing is connected to the internet 2 there s zero proof of any actual hacking malware or illegal tampering with any votes in any of these states the examples given in the report are hypothetical possibilities that were discussed well before the election with known equipment limitations before this election took place in stein s own words let me be very clear we do not have evidence of fraud stein says we do not have smoking guns what we do have is an election that was surrounded by hacking 3 are politics the real motivation if this recount were truly about the election s integrity and improving public confidence in the process why not include recounts in new hampshire and nevada which were states that clinton won with very narrow margins in new hampshire clinton won by 2 700 votes which is the smallest margin of victory in any state in nevada the hillary clinton margin of victory was 26 000 votes far less than the trump margin of victory in pennsylvania 4 the threshold for a recount will likely not be reached in pennsylvania there would need to be evidence of widespread voter fraud for a court ordered recount in pa for example a candidate can t actually file for a vote recount under pennsylvania law instead they would have to challenge a county board regarding its vote computations and a state appeals judge would have to rule that a statewide recount is necessary that means the clinton campaign or in this case ms stein s team would either have to request a recount by petition in every voting district or present a prima facie case showing voter fraud prima facie is a lower threshold than beyond a reasonable doubt a judge would just have to rule that fraud probably occurred in order to call for a recount however jill stein said she does not have evidence of fraud further as the article explains what should be most troubling for clinton supporters who want her to ask for a pennsylvania recount is that in the past these recounts have yielded a shift of just a couple hundred votes certainly not enough to overturn anything in pennsylvania clinton s team would have to rely on proving massive voter fraud enough for a pennsylvania court to rule the entire state invalid an unprecedented and nearly impossible feat 5 people are giving millions of dollars to a cause that is a waste of their money based upon many flawed assumptions and some hopes and dreams that are unrealistic no doubt these people want hillary clinton to win and they see this as a longshot possibility however they are being deceived and misled based on generalities about election hacking risks that were known for many months prior to the election just because emails were hacked from hillary clinton s server or other emails accounts were hacked that related to the election does not in any way prove that voting machines were hacked or counts were tampered with in any state to give false hope to these people is similar to collecting money to promise a white christmas to the children in miami some are even calling this a scam although i would not go that far this website points out then there is the fine print that will allow stein s campaign to keep all of the money even if no recounts are done we cannot guarantee a recount will happen in any of these states we are targeting we can only pledge we will demand recounts in those states if we raise more than what s needed the surplus will also go toward election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform 6 these recounts set up a dangerous precedent for future elections and potentially for many other areas of life where anyone can question any numbers based upon the view maybe there was a hack somewhere somehow almost any data can be questioned using this type of superficial analysis the thinking goes along the lines if we turn over enough rocks we re bound to find something right yes one fear is that this actually gives all cybersecurity pros a bad name if when experts make these type of claims with huge caveats which create numerous opportunities to deny responsibility is our new threshold a potential for hacking if we use that litmus test in other areas of life what can be excluded or in j alex halderman s own words were this year s deviations from pre election polls the results of a cyberattack probably not i believe the most likely explanation is that the polls were systematically wrong rather than that the election was hacked my reaction really in that case why did you go public if i were to use that logic in any of my many cybersecurity roles regarding security incidents in government i would be fired or at least sent back to reexamine the specific details before going public might this just be a pr stunt for these people to get more attention 7 the states involved have extensive certification processes and procedures which were followed as i said back on nov 5 before we knew the election outcomes and when hillary clinton was leading in most of the polls we should trust the vote for many reasons i still believe this unless specific facts show otherwise anyone who clams fraud or other election problems needs to come forward with real evidence polls being wrong is not evidence of election fraud 8 a recount will not improve integrity or confidence in this election as jill stein is claiming imagine if this process does move forward and a recount is begun in one more or states numerous global reporters will rush to the state s involved to watch the process unfold on live tv while hopefully the coverage will not be quite as intense and exhausting as the florida recount of 2000 the focus will dominate the news for weeks we will hear assorted experts offer theories opinions and select facts regarding what is going on and what they expect to happen next and if hillary clinton could actually become our next president and not donald trump rabbit trails will be followed i suspect that this extensive scrutiny may actually lower not raise the level of confidence in these elections with no change in the overall outcome of the winner 9 government resources will be diverted time energy money will be taken away from other government projects assuming the actual cost of the effort is paid by the money raised by stein government staff will still be required to be pulled off of other meaningful projects and priorities to complete the recount process just the coordination and project management will be immense and there will an untold number of related impacts as this article explains the cost for paper ballot recounts in each precinct in michigan will be 125 for stein do you really think this total process can be completely done for 125 per precinct with all government costs included i think that extra money and time spent will come from somewhere else in government 10 the country will not move on to the important process of uniting moving forward and focusing on governing with our next president of the united states this effort is a major distraction and brings on more uncertainty at a time that we don t need it as a nation many on the right claim this recount effort is just coming from sore losers who can t admit defeat i m not so sure but whether you agree with that analysis or not there is no doubt that these recounts will extend the election uncertainty for longer and fuel more anger final thoughtsthe u s department of homeland security under the obama administration was helping state election teams in at least 46 states and they have not come out and even implied any hacking of voter machines occurred don t you think that they would have raised red flags by now if they expected wrongdoing meanwhile jill stein has every legal right to request these recounts but that does not make it a smart or the right thing to do these recounts will not have the results she is claiming worse than that naming the russians or pointing to unknown hackers as the reason for the recounts will open up governments to a plethora of current and future problems we are witnessing a sad close to the 2016 presidential election which is being driven by hypothetical hacking scenarios based on the lie that if pollsters didn t get the results they expected someone must have been hacked finally there is no doubt that all states need improvements to the voting machines used and the processes followed to count the votes these improvements should begin immediately for upcoming elections in 2017 and beyond audits as described by wired magazine make sense moving forward nevertheless cybersecurity pros must be extra careful how often they cry hacked and never throw in a maybe or perhaps to cover their tracks and deny accountability later for entire story government technology',\n",

takes office on jan 20 to help increase freedom and prosperity for cuban people after the death of fidel castro but his initial reaction to castro s death sidestepped whether the incoming president would make good on a threat made late in his white house campaign to reverse president barack obama s moves to open relations with the cold war adversary obama used his executive powers on a series of steps to ease trade travel and financial restrictions against cuba arguing it was time to try diplomacy after the half century long economic embargo against cuba had failed to shake the regime trump s first statement on cuba policy since the nov 8 election issued from his palm beach florida resort where he and his family were spending the weekend after the thanksgiving holiday did not address whether he would roll back obama s measures because of concerns about religious and political freedom in cuba though the tragedies deaths and pain caused by fidel castro cannot be erased our administration will do all it can to ensure the cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty trump said in the statement while cuba remains a totalitarian island it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long and toward a future in which the wonderful cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve he said trump has just begun to fill out the top ranks of his national security team and has not yet named his top diplomat the secretary of state who will play a major role in formulating policy on cuba he last week named mauricio claver carone a political lobbyist who has strongly criticized obama s efforts to normalize relations with cuba and supports maintaining the u s embargo against the island to his transition team at the u s treasury department the agency is responsible for enforcing u s trade and travel restrictions on cuba claver carone is director of the u s cuba democracy political action committee claver carone was not immediately available for comment on saturday trump s initial statement was viewed by some to mark a softening from his rhetoric on cuba policy late in the campaign one u s intelligence official told reuters speaking on the condition of anonymity this may be one place where his business interests prod him to take a more pragmatic course even if that angers the hard core anti castro elements of both parties the official told reuters a second u s official noted the foreign policy advisers trump has named thus far are not known to have any particular interest in cuba that may mean trump s economic team will have more sway over cuba policy which could lead to a more pragmatic approach the second official said an aggressive policy by trump would close off lucrative opportunities to u s businesses and hand them to european or asian firms and would hurt companies like american airlines aal o due to start commercial flights to havana on monday for the first time in half a century trump a new york businessman and former reality tv star with an unconventional approach to politics started his campaign saying he was open to lifting the long standing embargo on trade with cuba in january he said on fox news that he was in favor of opening it up with cuba but wanted a better deal than obama had made comments he repeated in a debate with republican rivals in march i would want to make a strong solid good deal because right now everything is in cuba s favor trump said in march saying he would probably have the embassy closed in havana until a new deal was made when obama visited cuba later that month trump said in an interview with cnn that he probably would continue to normalize economic and diplomatic relations with cuba and would even open a trump hotel in cuba if the conditions were right i think cuba has certain potential and i think it s ok to bring cuba into the fold but you have to make a much better deal he said noting he was worried cuba would sue the united states for reparations for damage caused by its decades long embargo on cuba cuba policy was not part of a major foreign policy address trump delivered in april after he secured his party s nomination his position shifted to a more traditional republican position at a miami rally in september trump said he would roll back obama s cuban policy reforms unless cuban leaders allowed religious freedom and freed political prisoners the next president can reverse them and that i will do unless the castro regime meets our demands trump told supporters his vice

american who ran against trump to be the republican presidential candidate the future of cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the cuban people and now more than ever congress and the new

the flags wave and the songs play as the parades march to celebrate another 4th of july picnic meals are eaten while children frolic in the warn sunshine of summer few people reflect on the true meaning that established the solemn commemoration of the nation s birth the reality of this post federation of independent state sovereignty is that a centralized federal behemoth has superseded the original intent of thomas jefferson s vision that government is best which governs least today the society that exists demands compliance or compels obedience by way of punishment the empire that emerged after world war ii has established an amerika imperium with the consistent dumbing down of the youth indoctrinated in government schools and the mind control impact from the mass media the culture has abandoned the timeless principles that our country was founded upon in the essay independence day for whom the struggle for freedom and liberty was fought against the british empire most citizens acclaim this revolution as the greatest achievement of a besieged population ponder just how far the promises from a rebellion of englishmen has deteriorated into a dumping ground for foreigners who do not believe in the values and responsibilities upon which this struggle was fought for a more precise view of the meaning of independence day the true reasons for waging a war to create a beacon of hope in the new world has a history that fewer people understand much less devote their allegiance to its preservation just how has a country of freedom loving patriots allowed the systematic destruction of their once beloved nation a primer on some of the reasons for this betrayal can be reviewed in the end of independence day essay with the internationalism of foreign policy the traditional america first viewpoint of the founding fathers was abandoned the end result is that the death of independence is now upon us over the decades a replacement aristocracy emerged that transplanted the elected representation of the public will the real control behind the legislative office holders and certainly the executive branch under any president demonstrate that ignoring the canons within the declaration of independence is a prime requirement to wield power in washington dc frustrated and disenfranchised citizens voted for donald trump based upon his articulation on the issues that genuine patriots would support no matter what anyone thinks of the man or believes about the inordinate attacks directed at him and his administration the indisputable fact is that the establishment wants to see him fail simply put the actual rulers of the global supremacy wants the financial dominance of the central banking system to continue and perfect their governance amerika is pivotal in maintaining their forced submission the basis of the shadow government surreptitiously functions in the darkness of public exposure routing out any effort or initiative for independent representation is the standard modus operandi the populace is generally ignorant of the existence of this empowerment cabal people are led to believe that the deep state is simply the technocrats that never leave their positions of administrating agencies regretfully it is not realistic to facilitate a clean sweep of the careerists who routinely sabotage any directive that compromises the interests of the permanent bureaucracies and their masters trump may prove to be a dragon slayer but the hatching of genetically rotten eggs continues the column can the swamp really be drained addresses this issue the single most persistent element that drives authorities away from the maxims of the american revolution centers within the attitude that government acts in the interests of the people such deficiencies in understanding of the vile nature and the actual record of coercive regimes stands as a major obstacle to the liberation of the mind rejecting the legitimacy of the criminal syndicate that purports to be the lawful authority is essential examine the book review american amnesia the liberal case for government which debunks the lunacy that rationalizes the worship of government control over society such a demented academic viewpoint logically concludes that the celebration of independence day must be based upon the triumph of the all powerful leviathan government over a decentralized autonomous and local accountable authority authentic nationalism must rest upon the pillars of individual liberty when the 4th of july becomes a cartoon carnival of the deep state the only beneficiary is the shadow government president trump is not the cause nor is he the solution to reinstitute an american renaissance revolution however to the degree that he can raise the consciousness within the country his presence in the oval office becomes a peril to the comrades who want to destroy our national independence when the hypocrites from the political class and the treachery from the fake news purveyors is confronted then and only then will a real independence celebration become a true national commemoration the enemy is not just at the gate they have become the jailers for the deplorable resistance the intent is to isolate and eliminate the heartland dissenters because they are the only threat that has the ability to win the infowar of ideas since the

subsist in a pseudo reality imposed by a hostile new world order this perceptibility is categorically opposite to the fundamental precepts that were universally accepted when the country was founded

government efforts to stop the killings are failing partly because intelligence gathering to counter such attacks is so disjointed security sources say more than 300 people were killed in the bombing in the heart of the capital on saturday the deadliest attack in the history of the horn of africa nation the islamist insurgency al shabaab was blamed for the blasts which happened when a car bomb and a truck bomb headed for the airport detonated prematurely somali security services and the donor nations working with them are both to blame for disorganization in the divisions that are supposed to be working to detect and stop such attacks said hussein moalim mohamud sheikh ali a former national security adviser to the president the national security architecture is in tatters he told reuters the shabaab attacks are a symptom of the greater political dysfunction of the state the increasing frequency and growing size of the attacks threaten the fragile security gains made in somalia ahead of the withdrawal of african union peacekeepers at the end of the year they also are a concern for other countries in the region where al shabaab is active such as kenya and uganda in 2016 723 people died in 395 attacks in somalia up from 46 dead in 36 attacks in 2010 according to a confidential report produced earlier this year by nairobi based thinktank sahan research initial swab tests at the site of the attack showed traces of potassium nitrate a fertilizer component indicating al shabaab is now manufacturing explosives as well as buying them or harvesting them from munitions experts say competing programs funded by different donor nations and the lack of a centralized database are hurting efforts to analyze intelligence related to improvised explosive devices ieds four western and one somali security source told reuters a letter from somalia s minister of internal security addressed to the united states britain and the united nations in may complained of competition and secrecy among agencies gathering intelligence multiple actors involved means this process is highly disorganized causing a severe problem for the governmental counter terrorism efforts said the letter seen by reuters the pressure is building on president mohamed abdullahi mohamed who must ensure somalia s fledgling security forces are ready to step in when the 22 000 strong au force leaves his government is already stalling on releasing a report into a joint u s somali raid on bariire in august that residents say killed 10 civilians political disagreements threaten co operation between somalia s federal and regional forces last week the minister of defense and army chief resigned without giving reasons the interior ministry spokesman resigned this week somali police did not respond to requests for comment high grade explosives obtaining high grade military explosives the material that makes a bomb explode involves harvesting them from captured munitions or buying them from someone else making their own explosive allows the insurgents to build more and bigger bombs according to the sahan report and an upcoming report from a u n panel of experts that monitors an arms embargo on somalia according to the u n report which is due to be published next month the u s terrorist explosive device analytical center which is funded by the federal bureau of investigation has confirmed the presence of potassium nitrate in six major vehicle borne bomb incidents since 2016 the potential use of hme home made explosive by al shabaab would allow the group to rely less on the process of harvesting explosives from munitions which is slow and laborious allow ing the militant group to increase the frequency and explosive weight of its ieds said the report al shabaab which wants to overthrow somalia s u n backed government and impose strict islamic law has not yet claimed responsibility for saturday s attack in keeping with previous incidents in which large numbers of civilians have been killed mass civilian deaths have caused deep divisions among fighters a security source with knowledge of discussions within the group said a former top al shabaab commander mukhtar robow abu mansur condemned the attack and was photographed by local media donating blood robow defected to the government in august after the u s government removed a 5 million bounty for his capture two mogadishu based security sources outlined the events leading up to the latest attack to reuters they said a car bomb and a truck bomb were deployed to hit mogadishu international airport a warren of buildings ringed by barbed wire and blast walls that house contractors diplomats and a european union military training mission one bomb would have breached a checkpoint opening the way for a larger bomb one of the western security contractors told reuters they also had fighters nearby ready to come inside the base the driver of the car bomb had been driving through checkpoints for a week ahead of the attack paying small bribes and getting security forces used to his presence he said a larger truck entered the city and passed through one checkpoint but was stopped at one known as kilometer five panicking he tried to force his way through but got snarled in traffic next to a fuel truck i could see the truck speeding i also heard few gunshots behind it police must have been chasing it

divider what followed was the blast and smoke the fireball tore through the intersection incinerating hundreds of civilians many were too badly burned to be identified and were buried in mass graves

peach fuzz mustache below a mop of black hair his transformation from high school football player to perpetrator of america s worst mass shooting raises questions about whether red flags were missed over the depth of his apparent sympathies with muslim extremists as families of the victims grieved and the nation recoiled at the scale of yet another mass shooting a picture began to emerge of the 29 year old killer as a quiet devout person who in recent years displayed a hateful and violent streak early on sunday he stormed a packed gay nightclub in orlando florida with a handgun and ar 15 semi automatic rifle fatally shooting 50 people before police killed him fifty three others were wounded many critically his ex wife sitora yusufiy described him as bipolar and emotionally disturbed with a violent temper she said she had been beaten and otherwise physically abused by mateen during outbursts in which he would express hatred towards everything she was rescued by family members just four months into a stormy marriage that began in 2009 and ended in divorce she said he would often get into fights with his parents but as i was the only one in his life most of the violence was directed towards me she told reporters in boulder colorado outside a home where she was staying she said he aspired to be a police officer and had worked as a correctional officer at a detention center for juvenile delinquents in fort pierce florida and had once sought admission to a police academy in fort pierce on florida s southeast coast 120 miles 195 km from the shooting the imam at the mosque that mateen attended for nearly 10 years described him as a regular worshipper who was quiet and rarely interacted with the congregation he hardly had any friends syed shafeeq rahman who heads the islamic center of fort pierce told reuters he would come with his little son at night to pray and after he would leave rahman said mateen never approached him regarding any concerns about homosexuals he usually prayed at the mosque a few times a week mostly in evenings and as recently as friday but he didn t display signs of radicalism according to fellow worshippers interviewed by reuters mateen was born in new york of afghan descent but spent most of his life in florida attending martin county high school in stuart a small city about a 20 minute drive from the fort pierce condominium where had most recently lived a classmate described him as a typical teen who played football a school yearbook image of mateen was seen by reuters samuel king who was one year ahead of mateen said the two often spoke after mateen graduated in 2004 king waited tables at ruby tuesday s restaurant at treasure coast square a mall where mateen worked at gnc the nutrition store he said king who is openly gay said the mateen he knew until 2009 did not appear to be anti homosexual what is shocking to me is that the majority of the staff at ruby tuesday s when i worked there were gay he clearly was not anti gay at least not back then he did not show any hatred to any of us while at gnc mateen lifted weights and got really buff king said describing mateen as gregarious and talkative in the immediate years after high school something must have changed since he last saw him he added mateen s father mir seddique told nbc news the massacre was not related to religion he said his son turned angry when he saw two men kissing in miami a couple of months ago the fbi twice interviewed mateen for having suspected ties to islamist militants the first investigation took place in 2013 when mateen made inflammatory comments to co workers that indicated sympathy for militants fbi special agent in charge ron hopper told a news conference in orlando at the time mateen worked as a security guard at g4s a british owned multinational company that is among the world s largest private security firms he joined g4s in september 2007 carried a gun as part of his duties and was employed with the company at the time of the shooting as an armed security officer the company said g4s provides security to federal buildings in florida mateen was investigated and interviewed twice but the fbi was unable to verify the substance of his comments hopper said daniel kime a security guard employed along with mateen by at g4s in the fort pierce area said he met mateen briefly three or four times every time i saw him he never smiled if you said good morning he d just walk right by you like he had a chip on his shoulder kime told reuters daniel gilroy who said he was a co worker of mateen s at g4s said that mateen s anger was constant any time a female or a black person would come by he would use horrible words he told fox news in 2014 hopper said mateen was investigated and interviewed again this time for suspected connections to moner mohammad abu salha an american citizen who became a suicide bomber in syria in 2014 hopper said mateen s contact with abu salha was minimal and it was deemed that he did not constitute a substantive threat at that time hopper said mateen was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of sunday s attack he said mateen called during the massacre to pledge allegiance to islamic state also known as isis which in recent years declared a caliphate over large swathes of iraq and syria but the depth of that commitment is unclear mateen also mentioned the boston marathon bombers during the call which he made 20 minutes into the shootings authorities said mateen s former wife said she met mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to florida to marry him according to the washington post he was not a stable person she said he beat me he would just come home and start beating me up

supporters have had a key weapons charge against them dropped in a recent pretrial hearing but there is still a major legal battle ahead of them the charges stem from an event in april 2014 when federal bureau of land management blm agents tried to seize bundy s cattle over a dispute between the ranchers and the government about grazing fees in what the ranchers saw as federal over reach in management of public land being at the heart of the dispute mark anderson reports on the developing story of the bundy ranch trials in the article below from american free press mark anderson american free pressa key charge on weapons was recently dropped from the charges that were filed against nevada ranchers cliven bundy his sons and several of their supporters over their protest in 2014 so far the case has been split into three separate trials set to start soon in las vegas afp will continue to follow this case as it evolves throughout the summer las vegas nev a federal judge in a pretrial hearing on feb 2 dismissed the third count related to firearms in the 16 count indictment against rancher cliven bundy and 17 others stemming from their april 2014 resistance of a crackdown carried out by federal agents in bunkerville located in southern nevada the standoff happened when federal agents unsuccessfully tried to seize bundy s cattle following a decades long dispute that according to the government was over unpaid grazing fees the event is widely seen as a collision of two worldviews emblematic of western landowners longtime efforts to resist and turn back what they see as heavy handed federal micro management of vast stretches of western lands while the las vegas review journal online called u s district judge gloria navarro s decision to drop count three as a minor victory for the men accused of organizing a mass assault on law enforcement other observers have insisted that federal agents especially those from the bureau of land management were the actual assailants judge navarro ruled to drop that count amid requests by the defense for several of the charges contained in the federal indictment to be dismissed according to the journal paralegal tatum wehr assistant to bret whipple attorney for cliven bundy told this afp writer feb 3 that navarro s decision applies to all the defendants awaiting trial that was seconded by roger roots an astute montanan who s a legal adviser to both cliven bundy and his son ryan roots explained to afp in a phone interview that while the dropped count has to do with the alleged use of a gun to impede federal officers the three other similar gun counts that weren t dropped allege the use of a gun to assault threaten and interfere with federal officers in his view those are just three ways of saying the same basic thing and that such wording is a deliberate way for the feds to get something to stick roots added that a motion to dismiss the case was filed on feb 2 that will be ruled on in a couple weeks unless that succeeds this thing is definitely going to trial he said adding this case is a big exposure for these guys we re talking high stakes according to roots the three remaining gun counts carry mandatory minimum sentences of several years each under what he described as an evil statute usc 18 sect 924 c it carries stiff sentences especially for second offenses and mandates that the sentences be served consecutively instead of the usual concurrent approach the defendants could be looking at 25 years to life depending on how many counts stick as roots understands it roots also said the federal government has been withholding critically important evidence from the defense amid severe moral and ethical breaches and enormously wasteful and improper spending of tax dollars during the standoff by blm agent dan love a key figure in this saga and with love s testimony being the only thing the grand jury heard in the bundy case before issuing its indictment meaning that the grand jury s inherent right to do its own investigation was never exercised the federal case evidently is far weaker than many people assume an insightful overview of love s behavior concerning the bunkerville standoff and related matters can be heard here in an interview with brianna bundy wife of defendant mel bundy conducted by ksdz fm the twister in nebraska they blm agents laugh and joke about shooting women shooting children and dogs and horses brianna told ksdz referring to evidence in the form of body cam footage evidently being withheld from public knowledge love is accused of

said moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s at a new york news conference the tearful nelson said moore groped her tried to pull her shirt off and shove her head in his lap then warned that no one will believe you if she told anyone i was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop said nelson a waitress at an alabama restaurant where moore often ate when the incident occurred i had tears running down my face moore a christian conservative and former chief justice of the alabama supreme court has refused to withdraw from the race his campaign released a statement denying any sexual misconduct with anyone and saying the new allegations were part of a witch hunt at a news conference in gallant alabama on monday night moore told reporters that nelson s accusations are absolutely false the birmingham news reported i never did what she said i did the newspaper quoted moore as saying i don t even know the woman i don t know anything about her mcconnell told reporters in his home state of kentucky that party officials were considering whether a republican write in candidate could be found to challenge moore in the dec 12 special election i think he should step aside said mcconnell who previously said moore should leave the race if the allegations were true i believe the women republican senators orrin hatch susan

majority gardner the head of the senate republican campaign arm said moore was unfit to serve in the senate if he refuses to withdraw and wins the senate should vote to expel him because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the united states senate gardner said in a statement senator john cornyn the senate s no 2 republican withdrew his endorsement but said alabama voters should make the final judgment on moore another prominent conservative who had endorsed moore senator ted cruz said moore should either clearly refute the allegations or if they are true drop out i am not able to urge the people of alabama to support his candidacy so long as these allegations remain unrefuted cruz told reporters in the capitol moore 70 had been a heavy favorite to win the election

sexual contact with a 14 year old girl when he was in his 30s he said on twitter that mcconnell was the person who should step down he has failed conservatives and must be replaced moore said the

of president donald trump in the primary had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by jeff sessions when he became u s attorney general earlier this year the growing furor over moore sets up a confrontation between establishment republicans and moore s supporters in the party s populist movement led by former white house chief strategist steve bannon a democratic win in alabama would be a blow to trump s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year s congressional elections giving democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the senate it is too late to remove moore s name from the ballot but mcconnell told reporters he was looking at potential write in candidates who could mount a successful campaign asked if strange might be a candidate again he said we ll see

determines if it should be routed to a specialty group this determination is based upon facts and circumstances of the stated activities within part ii of the application rather than names or labels

refugee admissions ryan is not one of the 84 cosponsors of babin s bill to halt the refugee operation and he recently told sean hannity that he does not support halting resettlement because we re a

refuse to repatriate criminal aliens 7 ryan s omnibus quadruples h 2b foreign worker visasdespite ryan s pledge not to move an immigration compromise with president obama tucked 700 pages into ryan s spending bill is language that would resuscitate and expand a controversial provision of the schumer rubio gang of eight plan to increase the h 2b visa program the provision would quadruple the number of h 2b visas for unskilled guest workers for a total of more than 250 000 writes immigration attorney ian smith the americans who fill these jobs are typically society s most vulnerable including single women the disabled the elderly minorities teenagers students and first generation immigrants smith explains a recent buzzfeed expos revealed how this program allows businesses to discriminate

decade ago with the passage of the 2006 secure fence act the american people were promised a 700 mile double layer border fence however funding for the fence was later gutted and as a result its construction was never completed despite heightened media focus over the past six months about americans desire for this barrier to illegal entry ryan s bill does not require that funds be allocated to finish the construction of the 700 mile double layer fence a vote could occur as early as thursday after midnight giving lawmakers and the public only one full business day to review the 2 242 page package the ryan pelosi package represents nothing short of a complete and total betrayal of the american people yet ryan s omnibus serves a second and equally chilling purpose by locking in the president s refugee immigration and spending priorities ryan s bill is designed to keep these fights out of congress by getting them off the table for good delivering obama these wins and pushing these issues beyond the purview of congress will suppress public attention to the issues and in so doing will boost the candidacy of the republican establishment s preferred presidential contenders who favor president obama s immigration agenda what may prove most discouraging of all to americans is that recent reports reveal that conservatives in the so called house freedom caucus are praising ryan even as he permanently locks in these irreversible and anti american immigration policies according to politico the house freedom caucus will give ryan a pass even as he funds disastrous policies

president after being overlooked for years ramaphosa s political abilities have been apparent for decades whenever nelson mandela needed a breakthrough in talks to end apartheid he would turn to the then trade union leader with a reputation as a tenacious negotiator using skills honed in pay disputes with mining bosses ramaphosa steered those talks to a successful conclusion allowing mandela to sweep to power in 1994 as head of the african national congress mandela wanted ramaphosa to be his heir but was pressured into picking thabo mbeki by a group of anc leaders who had fought apartheid from exile it has taken more than two decades for ramaphosa now deputy president to get another chance to run the country graphic anc election in south africa here graphic south african economy here the 65 year old is one of the two favorites to become anc leader at a party vote this weekend whoever wins the anc race will probably be the country s next president because of the ruling party s electoral dominance ramaphosa s ambition for the presidency has been clear through his whole adult life he was quite clearly wounded by his marginalization in the mbeki period said anthony butler a politics professor who has written a biography of ramaphosa the choice between ramaphosa and his main rival for the anc s top job former cabinet minister nkosazana dlamini zuma will help determine the pace of reform in south africa and affect how the country gets on with foreign powers a trained lawyer with an easygoing manner ramaphosa has vowed to fight corruption and revitalize an economy which has slowed to a near standstill under president jacob zuma that message has gone down well with foreign investors and anc members who think zuma s handling of the economy could cost the party dearly in 2019 parliamentary elections dlamini zuma has promised a radical brand of wealth redistribution which is popular with poorer anc voters who are angry at racial inequality while ramaphosa who declined to be interviewed for this story has backed radical economic transformation an anc plan to tackle inequality he tends to couch his policy pronouncements in more cautious terms analysts say the race between ramaphosa and dlamini zuma who was previously married to president zuma is too close to call unlike zuma or dlamini zuma ramaphosa was not driven into exile for opposing apartheid which some of the party s more hardline members hold against him he fought the injustices of white minority rule from within south africa most prominently by defending the rights of black miners as leader of the national union of mineworkers num a member of the relatively small venda ethnic group ramaphosa was able to overcome divisions that sometimes constrained members of the larger zulu and xhosa groups a massive miners strike led by ramaphosa s num in 1987 taught business that cyril was a force to be reckoned with said michael spicer a former executive at anglo american he has a shrewd understanding of men and power and knows how to get what he wants from a situation spicer said the importance of ramaphosa s contribution to the talks to end apartheid is such that commentators have

happened in benghazi we know that the state department was and still is protecting hillary clinton and obama we know that it s hard to keep up the hope that these crooks will be held accountable for what they did rest assured that judicial watch is calling out the state department on this and especially patrick kennedy see more on kennedy below washington dc judicial watch today announced that u s district judge amy berman jackson has ordered the u s department of state to turn over to judicial watch eight identical paragraphs of previously redact material in two september 13 2012 hillary clinton emails regarding phone calls made by president barack obama to egyptian and libyan leaders immediately following the terrorist attack on the u s mission in benghazi both emails had the subject line quick summary of potus calls to presidents of libya and egypt and were among the emails stored on clinton s unofficial email server judge jackson reviewed the documents directly and rejected the government s contention that the records had been properly withheld under the foia b 5 deliberative process exemption judge jackson ruled the two records even if just barely predecisional are not deliberative the state department has pointed to very little to support its characterization of these two records as deliberative and the court s in camera review of the documents reveals that they do not fall within that category the full emails may reveal what former secretary of state hillary clinton and president obama knew about the september 11 2012 terror attack on the u s mission in benghazi following judge jackson s march 20 ruling the state department asked the court to reconsider the state department argued that due to an internal mistake it failed to claim that the emails were classified and therefore exempt from production under foia exemption b 1 in response judicial watch argues that the failure was not a mistake but instead was part of a deliberate effort by the state department to protect clinton and the agency by avoiding identifying emails on clinton s unofficial non secure email server as classified judicial watch s filing cites an interview of an fbi employee who told federal investigators that top state department official patrick kennedy pressured the fbi to keep clinton s emails unclassified the employee told the fbi he believes state ha d an agenda which involves minimizing the classified nature of the clinton emails in order to protect state interests and those of clinton fbi documents say kennedy offered the fbi additional positions overseas if the secret label the middle level of classification would be removed clinton who used a private server for her emails while she was secretary of state has contended she never sent or received classified information the fbi has ruled otherwise 4 key people out particularly patrick kennedy judicial watch s filing also cites an interview of a state department employee who told the fbi that the state department s office of legal counsel interfered with the foia processing of email from secretary clinton s server instructing reviewers to use exemption b 5 deliberative process exemption instead of exemption b 1 classified information exemption according to the fbi interview state s near east affairs bureau upgraded several of clinton s emails to a classified level with a b 1 release exemption redacted along with redacted attorney office of legal counsel called state s near east affairs bureau and told them they could use a b 5 exemption on a upgraded email to protect it instead of the b 1 exemption however the use of the b 5 exemption which is usually used for executive privilege related information was incorrect as the information actually was classified and related to national security which would be a b 1 exemption judicial watch argues an agency s deliberate withholding of a foia claim either to gain a tactical advantage or as appears to be the case here to protect the agency s interests and those of its former head is a motive undoubtedly inconsistent with foia s broad remedial purpose it counsels denying the government s request the emails in question were sent to then top administration officials including clinton deputy secretary of state william burns under secretary of state wendy sherman clinton deputy chief of staff jacob sullivan special assistant robert russo and deputy national security advisor denis mcdonough does president trump know his state and justice departments are still trying to provide cover for hillary clinton and barack

scurrilous attacks on me and my wife of 42 years it has been decided by others that i can no longer be as forceful as i need to be in leading the f b i and carrying out my responsibilities to the bureau and the nation he said it is because i believe in the principle of an independent f b i that i have refused to voluntarily resign mr clinton said that after reviewing mr sessions s performance attorney general janet reno had advised him that mr sessions should go after a thorough review by the attorney general of mr sessions s leadership of the f b i she has reported to me in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau similarly mr trump fired mr comey on the recommendation of his attorney general jeff sessions no relation to william s sessions there are no united states statutes that discuss the president s authority to remove the f b i director nyt s vince foster what the media won t tell you major media outlets reported wednesday on the supreme court hearing of california lawyer allan favish s case that government photographs of vincent foster s death scene be released for public viewing the media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that foster committed suicide because he was depressed but despite 10 years of denial by the major media the foster case has not closed as the supreme court hearing wednesday demonstrated the case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure and to conduct a full investigation into the case including a complete autopsy vince foster was not only deputy white house counsel but also the personal attorney to bill and hillary clinton on the night of foster s death top clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his west wing office in the days that followed federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of foster s office and strange death since foster s july 1993 death the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of bill and hillary in the major media but here s the undeniable truth there weren t five investigations into foster s death as the media report the park police best known for their meter and horse patrols around washington were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since president kennedy the park police contradicting standard procedure declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry later robert fiske selected by clinton s counsel bernie nussbaum and janet reno quickly confirmed the park police probe as a suicide but when ken starr entered the investigation he reopened the case his chief prosecutor in the case miquel rodriguez later quit the starr investigation claiming that starr s staff was engaging in a cover up of foster s death rodriguez a harvard educated federal prosecutor argued that one of the polaroid photos taken of foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on foster s neck never noted on the autopsy report favish s suit before the supreme court is seeking to release this photo among others no fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene not a suicide a careful fbi microscopic investigation of foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded fort marcy park to where his body was found years later starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such evidence according to the fbi report on vince foster s death below blonde hairs were found on the body of vince foster but were never investigated foster was found with little blood around his body and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim with two serial numbers made from the parts of three or more guns none of foster s fingerprints were found on the gun for years detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling significant questions were raised about the unusual gun a 38 colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers found conveniently in vince s hand the park police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913 and had no pedigree foster family members insisted neither foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver the ncic keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers on march 23 2001 the fbi responded to requests made by a man names craig brinkley serial number 356555 one of the numbers on the gun was never searched not by the fbi the park police or by that investigation by ken starr serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber that number was indeed searched by the park police on the evening of foster s death more exactly at 22 45 edt on july 20 1993 interestingly searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year before foster s death on march 3 march 7 and april 29 was someone checking to see that this gun had a clean predigree and was untraceable the bullet from the gun that supposedly killed foster was never found despite intensive searches despite claims to the contrary no one who knew foster including hillary web hubbell and his own wife saw signs of depression a so called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after foster s death the note was torn into 27 pieces yet an fbi examination found no trace of foster s fingerprints on the note and a top oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an obvious forgery despite the enormity of the case foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes the coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared suicides that were later found to be murders all of the x rays taken during the autopsy are missing complete crime scene photos don t exist the park police said all the photos were accidentally overexposed a series of close up polaroids which favish is suing for remain this is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case two new york homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out despite overwhelming evidence of a cover up the media won t question the official ruling ken starr who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the clintons during his intensive probe confirmed a ruling of suicide starr even hired o j simpson s defense expert to prove his case on august 23 2016 the daily mail revealed that fbi agents reported interviews documenting that hillary clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor vince foster in front of white house aides triggered the suicide of vince foster were missing from where they should be filed at the national archives on the first visit archivist david paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the fbi reports of interviews conducted by fbi agents on foster s death on a second visit archivist james mathis provided what he said were those same documents while the box contained dozens of fbi reports concerning foster s death including interviews with the medical examiner u s park police officers and white house aides about the contents of foster s office the reports on hillary clinton s role in his death were absent after filing a freedom of information request with the national archives martha murphy the archives public liaison reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant fbi files including those that had not been previously made public in response to foia requests he examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between hillary clinton and vince foster or the effects of a meeting between hillary clinton and vince foster on vince foster s state of mind murphy reported in an email after firing republican fbi director william s session president bill clinton temporarily replaced him with floyd i clarke and then on september 1 1993 he louis freeh became the fbi director right from the start the freeh fbi was drenched in controversy the screw ups were legion from the exposure of fraudulent fbi crime lab results to the wrongful blaming of an innocent man for the bombings at the atlanta olympics to the bloody standoff and shootout at ruby ridge',\n",

patients amid a wave of criticism from lawmakers and the public over the product s rapidly escalating price the list price of the drug will remain the same but the company said it would increase the maximum copay assistance program to 300 from 100 for patients who pay for the 2 pak in cash or who are covered by a commercial health insurer the price of epipen has skyrocketed to 600 from 100 since it was acquired by mylan in 2007 mylan also said it is doubling the eligibility for its patient assistance program which will eliminate out of pocket costs for uninsured and under insured patients and families government paid programs are not eligible for the copay assistance program ronny gal an analyst with bernstein said when all is said and done he estimates a total price reduction for epipen of 32 percent the price rose 27 percent in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same quarter a year ago thus we are basically rolling back the increase of the past year he said in all we estimate that today s news results in a 20 25 percent hit on epipen revenues he expects that to translate into a 3 4 percent hit to mylan s earnings per share over the next few years he estimates the company will earn 4 77 a share in 2016 and 5 58 in 2017 mylan is the latest company to be caught up in the growing outrage at apparently egregious drug price increases valeant pharmaceuticals international inc and turing pharmaceuticals have both been publicly excoriated for similar price increases presidential candidate hillary clinton who has spoken out against escalating drug prices welcomes the fact that mylan is now apparently open to taking steps to lower some of the cost sharing burdens imposed on families tyrone gayle a campaign spokesman said in a statement however he added discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of epipens are insufficient because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums clinton s view was echoed by democratic lawmakers including rep elijah cummings who said mylan s move is nothing but a public relations stunt that does nothing to help the majority of patients who need the drug offering a meager discount only after widespread bipartisan criticism is exactly the same tactic used by drug companies across the industry to distract from their exorbitant price increases he said in a statement nobody is buying this pr move any more mylan chief executive heather bresch defending the price in an interview on thursday on cnbc said her company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving epipen including making its needle invisible since acquiring the device from german generic drugmaker merck kgaa when we picked up this product they merck weren t spending a dollar on it said bresch bresch said mylan recoups less than half of epipen s list price because pharmacy benefit managers which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers are involved along with insurers and others democratic u s senator amy klobuchar said mylan s action was a welcome relief to many who are struggling to afford the medication but said it does not address the root of the problem of rising drug costs earlier this year clinton chastised drug companies for exorbitant pricing and unveiled a plan that she said would cut costs making the issue not only a hot election discussion topic but potentially an issue that could have policy implications if she is elected on wednesday clinton pressed mylan to voluntarily cut the epipen price sending the company s share price lower and pushing down biotech stocks mylan shares fell more than 10 percent this week before rising 3 2 percent on thursday after announcement of the discount program epipens are preloaded injections of epinephrine adrenaline used in case of a dangerous allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis that could cause death if untreated anaphylaxis can occur in as little as a couple of minutes of exposure to the allergen which can come in the form of food such as peanuts or insects such as bees certain medications or latex can also cause a severe reaction symptoms include itching swelling of the lips tongue and roof of the mouth tight chestedness and difficulty breathing people who are susceptible to such reactions are frequently advised to carry an epipen which can deliver an immediate emergency jolt of adrenaline to reverse the symptoms a group of lawmakers said on wednesday they had written the u s food and drug administration asking about its approval process for alternatives to the epipen fda spokeswoman theresa eisenman said in a statement the agency is reviewing the questions posed in the letter and will respond directly to the congressional members she noted that the fda does not have the authority to review or approve drug prices bresch daughter of democratic u s senator joe manchin of west virginia said she contacted members of congress over the past two days and asked to meet with them to discuss what she called an unsustainable drug pricing system she said one of the calls was to senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley r iowa who recently wrote a letter to

              " 'rare interview with white house secretary bill clinton had affairs with thousands of women monica lewinsky is alive today because of choices i made this is a mind blowing interview that confirms much of what many of us suspected about the clintons for some it may be even worse than what they believed to be true kudos to linda tripp for agreeing to do this interview people who cross the clinton s do usually fare too well in a rare interview linda tripp a pivotal figure in the monica lewinsky scandal revealed on sunday it was common knowledge while she worked in the west wing that bill clinton had affairs with thousands of women speaking on aaron klein investigative radio tripp for the first time divulged that she personally knew another white house staffer aside from lewinsky who was also having an affair with clinton that unnamed staffer was mentioned by tripp in various depositions but she has not spoken about it publicly she charged that hillary clinton not only knew about her husband s exploits she made it her personal mission to disseminate information and destroy the women with whom he dallied tripp says she cringes at the sight of clinton presenting herself as a champion of women s rights worldwide in a global fashion and yet all of the women she has destroyed over the years to ensure her political viability continues is sickening to me tripp documented evidence of lewinsky s phone calls about her relationship with bill clinton and submitted the evidence to independent counsel kenneth starr leading to the public disclosure of the affair she explained to klein that she did so because she believed her own life and lewinsky s were in danger saying that lewinsky was threatening clinton with outing the relationship tripp also used the interview to criticize what she says is the news media s unwillingness to investigate the clintons she singled out and thanked matt drudge of the drudge report declaring that without him things would have been very very different drudge s website was the first media outlet to break the lewinsky scandal after newsweek sat on the story tripp had unique access to the clintons because her office was directly adjacent to hillary s second floor west wing office for the entire time she served in the clinton white house from 1993 to the summer of 1994 with the exception of the first three months of the clinton administration when she sat just outside the oval office tripp s nonpartisan position was a carryover from the george h w bush administration in which she served monica lewinsky is alive today because of choices i made she told klein that her role in the lewinsky case followed years of alarm at what i had seen in the clinton white house particularly hillary and the different scandals whether it was filegate travelgate whitewater vince foster all of the scandals that had come before and were so completely obliterated in the mind s eye of the american people because of the way all of them were essentially discounted so i watched a lying president and a lying first lady present falsehoods to the american people so my dismay predated the january 1998 period when the monica lewinsky scandal surfaced to me it was very important that the american people see what i was seeing my years with the clintons were so disturbing on so many levels tripp maintains that she went public with the lewinsky evidence to ensure the intern s safety as well as her own she told klein i say today and i will continue to say that i believe monica lewinsky is alive today because of choices i made and action i took that may sound melodramatic to your listeners i can only say that from my perspective i believe that she and i at the time were in danger because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends i think that had it not become public when it did particularly in light of the paula jones lawsuit which was coming to a head with president clinton s deposition that we may well have met with an accident it s a situation where unless you lived it as i did you would have no real framework of reference for this sort of situation tripp said the young lewinsky 21 years old when she entered the white house as an intern was unaware of the danger that she faced she described lewinsky as a young girl smart clever but in this one area she was blinded and she fancied herself in love he fancied himself entitled it was nothing more than a servicing agreement she romanticized that there was an affair and when it didn t pan out the way she had hoped it would he had promised her he would bring her back to the white house as soon as the 1996 election campaign had finished when he didn t she essentially lost her mind and started acting in erratic and frightening ways threatening the president there came a point in july of 1997 when she not only threatened to expose the affair as she referred to it but also she at that time informed him that i knew all about it so at that time it became dangerous for monica and for me this was something that absolutely could never see the light of day and she never realized the implications of threatening a president or her behavior and i did tripp told klein that the biggest fallacy that most people believed is that this was a unique occurrence monica was somehow special and regrettably that s the farthest thing from the truth she said everyone knew within the west wing particularly those who spent years with him of the thousands of women now most of your listeners might find that difficult if not impossible to believe and i can tell you in the beginning i felt the same way but let me be clear here this is a pattern of behavior that has gone on for years and the abuse of women for years asked whether clinton was having affairs with others in the west wing tripp replied i know that to be true one in particular who i will not name told me this herself but as to the hundreds or thousands remember i worked closely with the closest aides to the president and it was a loosey goosy environment so there was not a lot of holding back so it was common knowledge let s put it this way within the west wing that he had this problem it was further common knowledge that hillary was aware of it tripp described the tense west wing atmosphere between what she characterized as two almost diametrically opposed clinton camps the dynamic between the two groups the bill clinton people and the hillary clinton people it was as though they were almost opposing forces but i can tell you that the one with the power and the one that instilled the fear in the other was the hillary camp and the bill clinton people would cower if she were coming into the area just as an example of the oval without notice there would be scurrying around to make sure there was no one in the wrong place at the wrong time shall we say it was a fascination to see the amount of energy that was expended covering up his behavior it was horrifying tripp said hillary personally targeted bill s female conquests and accusers with the future presidential candidate exhibiting behavior that is egregious and it s so disingenuous in my case for instance right after the lewinsky story broke she was heard directing her staff to get anything and everything on linda tripp so the defamation of character and the absolute assurance that my credibility would be destroyed began right away and it happens with any woman who is involved in any way either with him in a physical relationship or an assault or anything that can endanger their political viability tripp recalled hillary s january 27 1998 appearance on nbc s the today show in which she was seen as standing by her husband while blaming the lewinsky scandal on a vast right wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president she didn t do it in an honest way said tripp of clinton s nbc interview instead she lied which didn t surprise me and i will give her credit she is enormously effective and became a victim a wife who was betrayed this is someone who had no real personal problem with any of this behavior the problem was in it becoming public they had to continue to become electable she was the more aggressive one in ensuring that the political viability was not endangered in any way tripp told klein that hillary does not possess integrity on any level i just wish that your listeners could know the person that i knew because if they did there is not a chance she would be elected president tripp s ringside seat afforded her rare insight into the scandals of the 1990s and perhaps alleged wrongdoings to come with the west wing employee personally witnessing behavior that may have foreshadowed clinton s email scandal in which she is accused of sending classified materials through her personal server tripp said she noticed major differences in the manner in which classified material was handled by both the clinton and bush administrations in which she served president george h w bush s administration had a completely different way of operating on every level including on classified and secret material she said she continued all the regulations were followed right down to a cover sheet being essential if the document had had any sort of classifications the securing of classified documentation in safes the burn bags that were used if any sensitive material was to be disposed of all of this was familiar to me and followed every security protocol that i had experienced in the past when the clintons came in this was one of the things that i found appalling right from day one and it went hand and hand with the disdain for the military the military was present in the white house in the form of presidential aides the aide that carried the nuclear football just as an example and in the bush white house they were respected as they should be in the clinton white house they were disdained to see it treated this way and to see these people treated this way was disturbing tripp referred to clinton s private mail woes as classic hillary clinton in a nutshell she gets to decide what she does look the rules don t apply to the clintons if you understand that basic premise you understand the clintons for tripp clinton s use of a private server was all about control she has a need to control every single aspect of her life and you know anyone in government knows that any key stroke on a keyboard within a government agency belongs to the government it is not up to the employee on any level to control what happens to it for posterity for entire interview click here breitbart news',\n",

lb crocodile loose into the marshes throughout his campaign president elect donald j trump was adamant about getting rid of the redundant north american free trade agreement nafta so why then is he courting globalist acolyte david petraeus back in 2014 the new american reported former general and cia chief david petraeus shown a key figure in the globalist council on foreign relations and the shadowy bilderberg network boasted at a recent conference that the united states of america is set to be merged into the continental regime being erected under the north american free trade agreement nafta speaking at the margaret thatcher conference on liberty last week in london the ex commander of u s forces in afghanistan and iraq essentially celebrated the end of u s independence and by extension the demise of the constitution after america comes north america petraeus said confidently in answering the question about what comes after the united states the theme of the panel discussion are we on the threshold of the north american decade question mark i threw that away threw away the question mark and boldly proclaimed the coming north american decade says the title now he also boasted about how the three economies have been put together over the last 20 years as part of the implementation of the north american free trade act undoubtedly petraeus is not only a devotee of nafta and the tpp and ttip but he is a career committed globalist what s worse however is that after his disgraceful exit from washington david petraeus has become a regular attendee at the transatlantic elite globalist confab known as the bilderberg meeting a meeting where north american and european corporate elites billionaires and corrupted politicians meet in secret behind closed door to decide the coming year s political and economic agenda completely outside of any democratic accountability so from a globalization perspective petraeus has already sold us national sovereignty down the river and into the swamp in terms of anything trump was campaigning on petraeus would be globalist embed in his cabinet from a military perspective when you throw away the hype you might find that david petraeus is one of the most over rated figures in us military history after the unmitigated disaster that was iraq war petraeus was awarded the lofty title of the architect of the surge referring to the 2007 troop surge in iraq which itself was a complete media creation after the fact designed to rehabilitate president bush s abject failure but also to re inflate petraeus s public image in the wake of his own mishandling of classified intelligence into the hands of deep state operative paula broadwell the woman he was having an extramarital affair with petraeus was not only incompetent as a military man see article below he had passed state secrets to his mistress while he was head of the cia before resigning in 2012 normally a disastrous record such as this would disqualify any person from ever serving in public office again but petraeus is special he s one of the globalists most trusted inside men that s why his path is constantly being paved ahead of him many trump voters rejected hillary clinton for her own horrendous private email server debacle so why would they accept a highly compromised and convicted man in petraeus if trump is considering petraeus for any role in his government this would be the absolute height of hypocrisy and should be called out as such everyone should read the article below written by veteran cia analyst ray mcgovern listen to mcgovern s recent interview on patrick henningsen live last week on independent talk 1100 kfnx consortium news exclusive president elect trump s promise to drain the swamp of washington seems forgotten like so many political promises as he meets with swamp creatures such as disgraced gen david petraeus says ex cia analyst ray mcgovern by ray mcgovern the news that president elect donald trump called in disgraced retired gen david petraeus for a job interview as possible secretary of state tests whether trump s experience in hosting the celebrity apprentice honed his skills for spotting an incompetent phony or not does trump need more data than the continuing bedlam in iraq and afghanistan to understand that one can earn a princeton phd by writing erudite sounding drivel about counterinsurgency and still flunk war granted the shambles in which petraeus left iraq and afghanistan were probably more a result of his overweening careerism and political ambition than his misapplication of military strategy but does that make it any more excusable in 2007 adm william fallon commander of centcom with four decades of active duty experience behind him quickly took the measure of petraeus who was one of his subordinates while implementing a surge of over 30 000 u s troops into iraq several sources reported that fallon was sickened by petraeus s unctuous pandering to ingratiate himself fallon is said to have been so turned off by all the accolades in the flowery introduction given him by petraeus that he called him to his face an ass kissing little chickenshit adding i hate people like that sadly petraeus s sycophancy is not uncommon among general officers uncommon was fallon s outspoken candor the past decade has shown that obsequiousness to those above him and callousness toward others are two of petraeus s most notable character traits they go along with his lack of military acumen and his dishonesty as revealed in his lying to the fbi about handing over top secret notebooks to his biographer lover an indiscretion that would have landed a less well connected person in jail but instead got him only a mild slap on the wrist via a misdemeanor guilty plea indeed petraeus the epitome of a political general represents some of the slimiest depths of the washington swamp that president elect trump has vowed to drain petraeus cares desperately about the feelings of his fellow elites but shows shocking disdain for the suffering of other human beings who are not so important in early 2011 in afghanistan petraeus shocked aides to then president hamid karzai after many children were burned to death in a coalition attack in northeastern afghanistan by suggesting that afghan parents may have burned their own children to exaggerate their claims of civilian casualties and discredit the u s reported the washington post citing two participants at the meeting killing 60 people and then blaming the killing on those same people rather than apologizing for any deaths this is inhuman one afghan official said this is a really terrible situation yet on other occasions the politically savvy petraeus can be a paragon of sensitivity like when he is in danger of getting crosswise with the israel lobby never did petraeus s fawning shine through with more brilliance than when an unintentionally disclosed email exchange showed him groveling before arch neocon max boot beseeching boot s help in fending off charges that petraeus was anti israel because his prepared testimony to a congressional committee included the no brainer observations that israeli palestinian hostility presents distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests and that this conflict foments anti american sentiment due to a perception of u s favoritism for israel meanwhile al qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support so telling the truth perhaps accidentally in prepared testimony made petraeus squirm with fear about offending the powerful israel lobby but he apparently didn t hesitate to lie to fbi agents when he was caught in a tight spot for sharing highly sensitive intelligence with paula broadwell his mistress biographer but again petraeus realized that it helps to have influential friends a court gave him a slap on the wrist with a sentence of two years probation and a fine of 100 000 which is less than he usually makes for a single speaking engagement continue this article at consortium newsread more bilderberg news at 21st century wire bilderberg files',\n",

cairo to new york on saturday after president donald trump halted the entry of citizens from seven muslim majority countries sources at cairo airport said the passengers arriving in transit to cairo airport were stopped and re directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas the sources said trump on friday put a four month hold on allowing refugees into the united states and temporarily barred travelers from syria and six other muslim majority countries saying the moves would help protect americans from terrorist attacks he said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees immigrants and visitors i m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical islamic terrorists out of the united states of america don t want them here trump said earlier on friday at the pentagon we only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people he said the bans though temporary took effect immediately causing havoc and confusion for would be travelers with passports from iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen besides cairo it was not immediately clear whether other airports of countries listed by trump had swiftly implemented the ban arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter the order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution a move trump separately said was aimed at helping christians in syria that led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional one group said it would announce a court challenge on monday the council on american islamic relations said the order targets muslims because of their faith contravening the u s constitutional right to freedom of religion president trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of muslim countries under the banner of national security said greg chen of the american immigration lawyers association trump has long pledged to take this kind of action making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the nov 8 election but people who work with muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order even legal permanent residents people with green cards allowing them to live and work in the united states were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country or trying to return according to muslim advocates a civil rights group in washington on friday evening abed ayoub of the american arab anti discrimination committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders students people coming to the united states for medical care and others it s chaos ayoub said during his campaign trump tapped into american fears about islamic state militants and the flood of migrants into europe from syria s civil war saying refugees could be a trojan horse that allowed attackers to enter the united states in december 2015 he called for a ban on all muslims entering the united states drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the u s constitution his idea later evolved into a proposal for extreme vetting trump s order also suspends the syrian refugee program until further notice and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution trump said in an interview with the christian broadcasting network that the exception would help syrian christians fleeing the civil war there legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional if they are thinking about an exception for christians in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution said stephen legomsky a former chief counsel at u s citizenship and immigration services in the obama administration but peter spiro a professor at temple university beasley school of law said trump s action would likely be constitutional because the president and congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions it s a completely plausible prioritization to the extent this group is actually being persecuted spiro said the order may also affect special refugee programs for iraqis who worked for the u s government as translators after the 2003 invasion of iraq it is already affecting refugees and their families said jen smyers of the church world service a protestant faith based group that works with migrants smyers said she spoke to

committee said islamic state has threatened to use the u s immigration system making it important to do more screening i am pleased that president trump is using the tools granted to him by congress

pressuring the fbi to drop its insistence that an email on the private server she used while secretary of state contained classified information according to records of interviews with fbi officials released on monday the accusation against patrick kennedy the state department s most senior manager appears in the latest release of interview summaries from the federal bureau of investigation s year long investigation into clinton s sending and receiving classified government secrets via her unauthorized server although the fbi decided against declassifying the email s contents the claim of interference added fuel to republicans belief that officials in president barack obama s administration have sought to protect clinton a democrat from criminal liability as she seeks to succeed obama in the nov 8 election the fbi recommended against bringing any charges in july and has defended the integrity of its investigation clinton has said her decision to use a private server in her home for her work as the u s secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 was a mistake and has apologized one fbi official whose name is redacted told investigators that kennedy repeatedly pressured the various officials at the fbi to declassify information in one of clinton s emails the email was about the deadly 2012 attack on a u s compound in benghazi libya and included information that originated from the fbi which meant that the fbi had final say on whether it would remain classified a state department spokesman mark toner said kennedy was not pressuring the fbi but was just trying to understand better how the fbi s classification process worked the dispute began in the summer of 2015 as officials were busy reviewing the roughly 30 000 emails clinton returned to the state department ahead of their court ordered public release in batches in 2015 and 2016 the official said the state department s office of legal counsel called him to question the fbi s ruling that the information was classified but the fbi stood by its decision soon after that call one of the official s fbi colleagues received a call from kennedy in which kennedy asked his assistance in altering the email s classification in exchange for a quid pro quo the fbi official said he also joined at least two discussions in which kennedy continued to pressure the fbi about the email the official said kennedy appeared to be trying to protect clinton by minimizing the appearance of classified information in emails from the server that clinton used while she was the country s most senior diplomat in a separate interview summary among the 100 pages released on monday another unnamed fbi official confirmed a discussion of a quid pro quo he said kennedy told him in a phone call that the fbi s classification of the email caused problems for kennedy the official said he told kennedy he would look into the email which he had not yet seen if the state department would consider allowing more fbi agents to be posted in iraq in exchange the state department and the fbi both confirmed that a conversation about the email s classification and an increase in fbi slots in iraq took place but both agencies said there was no quid pro quo after a year long fbi investigation into the server fbi director james comey said in july he found that while laws governing classified information may have been broken no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges he said however that clinton and her staff had been extremely careless in handling information that had been classified to protect national security toner the state department spokesman said there was no quid pro quo and told reporters that it was the fbi official who raised the possibility with kennedy of allowing more agents in iraq during the conversation about the email after the conversation took place about the upgrading classification at the end of that there was a kind of oh by the way hey we re looking at how we want more slots in iraq toner said calling it a clear pivot in the topic of conversation no increase in fbi iraq slots resulted from this conversation he said the fbi also confirmed both topics were raised in the same conversation and that the fbi official who discussed the email and iraq with kennedy had since retired although there was never a quid pro quo these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review the fbi said in its statement which did not say what the outcome of the review was other officials have made similar complaints to investigators of unusual pressure not to mark information as classified in clinton s emails last year according to earlier documents the fbi released last month at least one official at the state department told investigators that there was pressure by senior department officials to mislead the public about the presence of classified information in clinton s emails ahead of their public release a summary released on monday showed at least two other state department officials making similar allegations one official who worked in the state department s office that deals with freedom of information act requests told investigators they felt intimidated by senior department officials if they suggested that any of clinton s emails on benghazi contained classified information and named kennedy as one of the officials who pressured employees to not label anything as classified the state department has said these allegations are also false ultimately the fbi told kennedy that declassification was not possible according to the interview summaries and the state department posted it online last year marked as classified with heavy redactions clinton s republican rival for the white house donald trump posted a video online on monday in which he said the fbi documents showed corruption at the highest levels this is collusion between the fbi department of justice and the state department to try and make hillary clinton look like an innocent person when she s guilty of very high crimes trump said later on monday trump proposed a series of ethics rules he said would crack down on government corruption including a five year ban on former administration officials lobbying after leaving government and a lifetime ban on senior officials lobbying for foreign governments he said former president bill clinton had a five year lobbying ban but lifted it at the end of his administration obama put his own revolving door rules in place at the beginning of his time in office several republican lawmakers called on obama to investigate kennedy and remove him from the department toner of the state department said kennedy has the full confidence of john kerry clinton s successor as secretary of state reince priebus the republican national committee s chairman said in a statement that obama who is campaigning for clinton to become his successor as president was trying to shield clinton and that she cannot be trusted with classified information paul ryan the top elected republican in the u s congress referred to the fbi summaries on twitter this bears all the signs of a cover up he wrote in 2015

syria lobbying tour through europe the middle east and north africa which was used to promote the us policy of regime change for syria by bringing together gulf arab monarchies saudi arabia qatar bahrain uea and others and other us client states to create a policy of economic military and social subterfuge which with the help of the cia and others has since destroyed large parts of syria now occupied by terrorist fanatical groups who are backed by the same friends of syria member nations managed by clinton from start these two wars were managed by what is allegedly a liberal or left wing democrat party they are anything but what this really means is that the next president clinton is already priming americans for a escalation of warfare in syria come this january here s why in 2011

of warthen on saturday september 17 the u s air force did exactly what that cia insider had called for in sustained air strikes four u s jets bombed a key syrian army position that had been defending the town of deir ez zor from isis daech fighters more than sixty syrian soldiers were killed and over a hundred wounded daech forces immediately took advantage of the strikes to overrun the government position in effect the u s air force acted as air cover for the islamic fanatics u s to advance against the legitimate army of syria this was not only a violation of the cease fire painstakingly worked out by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and u s secretary of state john kerry it was an open military aggression by the united states on the territory of a sovereign state the russians immediately called an emergency session of the united nations security council to respond to this deadly violation of the truce supposedly intended to facilitate peace negotiations and humanitarian aid when russian ambassador vitaly churkin took the floor to speak his american counterpart samantha power draped in her long red mane walked out to give a press conference that clearly illustrated the difference between russian and u s diplomacy churkin like lavrov a few days later cited facts and analysed the situation rationally samantha power put on a show of evasion and insults why all the fuss was her opening theme after all we halted the attack when we were informed that it was possible we might be hitting syrian regime personnel and vehicles she stated adding that if we did so that was not our intention that should settle the question who could believe that the united states might deliberately attack the regime their politicians have been saying must go the best defense is offensive and power can be most offensive even by russia s standards tonight s stunt replete with moralism and grandstanding is uniquely cynical and hypocritical she declared samantha power that conniving arriviste whose carefully constructed career has been built on moralism grandstanding cynicism and hypocrisy had all the nerve in the world to turn these epithets against the prime target of her own habitual moralism grandstanding cynicism and hypocrisy if the air strikes hadn t been enough to destroy russian confidence in dealing with the united states samantha power s contemptuous reaction was sure to do the trick act ii change the subjectnext ploy change the subject our little accidental bombing is nothing power implied compared to the alleged fact that since 2011 the assad regime has intentionally been striking civilian targets with horrifying predictable regularity here is the core of the samantha power fraud containing two elements 1 while good hearted bumbling america occasionally kills a few people by accident the others do it all the time and above allintentionally 2 killing civilians is what war is all about war is not about battles between armed forces for control of territory it is not about geopolitical power struggles it is about civilian victims at the close of her stunt grandstanding and scoring cheap points samantha power exhorted russia to stop the cheap point scoring and the grandstanding and the stunts and focus on what matters which is implementation of something we negotiated in good faith with them good faith they are supposed to believe we negotiated in good faith an agreement which we just flagrantly destroyed lo and behold only two days after the u s bombing of deie ez zor the subject was definitively changed when an international humanitarian aid convoy was attacked on its way to aleppo twenty aid workers were killed and the aid mission was halted without waiting for any evidence the unanimous cry went up from washington that the russians did it in the u n security council this time john kerry took the stage again the critical point was the contrast between what we certainly did and what they allegedly did yes we committed a terrible accident but what they allegedly did was worse i got to tell you people running around with guns on the ground from the air is a very different thing from trucks in a convoy with big un markings all over them kerry declared he was implying that the difference was between an understandable accident whose victims were running around with guns and an attack on civilians yes but in war attacking soldiers is the whole point it can make a difference in the outcome hitting an aid convoy is collateral damage as the u s calls it when the bombs are american by bombing deir ez zor the united states was taking part in a war in which syria is fighting for its life it cannot be ruled out that syrian forces attacked the aid convoy because the truce was already broken at deir ez zor and they believed it concealed weapons being transported to daech such things happen or the attack could have been carried out by rebels as an act of propaganda a false flag designed precisely to be used to accuse the adversary such things also happen it has already been established by careful research that the notorious al ghouta chemical weapons attack attributed to assad was almost certainly carried out by rebels precisely in order to incite the united states to cross the red line set by president obama and bomb damascus the war party which by now controls the pentagon much of the state department most of congress as well as leading media and think tanks has been castigating obama ever since for not having seized that opportunity to wage a full scale regime change war against syria the critics have never forgiven obama for accepting the russian proposal to use the occasion to rid syria of its chemical arsenal instead of overthrowing the syrian government but in recent weeks as the hillary clinton campaign grows more frantic obama himself has joined the war party image dusty boy omran act iii wallow in sentimentalityon september 20 president obama used a leaders summit on refugees to portray the syrian episode in what increasing appears to be world war iii as a sentimental children s story obama read the letter from 6 year old alex who lives in scarsdale new york expressing his wish to adopt omran daqneesh the bewildered 5 year old boy with a mop of dusty hair whose photo sitting in an orange ambulance seat was iconized across the world the letter provided to mass media by the white house with its childish writing but nearly perfect spelling was full of touching details about butterfly collections and shared toys obama read the letter as people reached for kleenexes all over the country and then commented those are the words of a six year old boy a young child you has not learned to be cynical or suspicious or fearful of other people because of where they come from how they look or how they pray we should all be more like alex imagine what the world would look like if we were the little boys are very cute very sweet fortunately omran daneesh s parents are alive so there is no need to adopt him many other children are dead notably in yemen killed by washington s ally saudi arabia with arms provided by the united states too late to adopt them we should all be more like alex obama tells his good people imagine indeed if all americans were as innocent and na ve as six year old children and indeed that seems to be the goal of government propaganda this propagandistic heartstring tugging is aimed at distracting from u s involvement in a long term joint criminal enterprise to overthrow a government that indeed did not discriminate against people because of how they pray and replace it by fanatics who are ready to behead people because of how they pray an infantilized public will believe that geopolitics and national sovereignty are just big words that don t mean anything an infantilized public will believe that when the united states goes to war it is all about protecting little children from their bad mean dictators whose only aspiration is to bomb their own people they will believe that the world out there is little red riding hood threatened by the big bad wolf and that there really is a santa claus it will never occur to an infantilized public that the war to destroy syria has been planned for years even though someone like general wesley clark revealed this years ago or that it is carried out to eliminate israel s enemies keep arabs busy killing each other and incidentally help saudi arabia spread its wahhabite fanaticism no that will never occur to them they won t even notice that the obama administration has now effectively given up any effort to justify the nobel peace prize so foolishly bestowed on the apprentice president and is now engaged in a scenario designed to prepare for hillary s next successful regime change war in syria and it won t occur to them that the photo of the little boy in the orange seat was quite deliberately iconized by western media as part of the

crime is so high in majority black cities and why americans need to stop blaming cops for the fatherless crisis that is plaguing inner city communities fatherless homes combined with the left s policies and attacks on free speech are creating thugs and cop killers it s important to shine a light on this anti cop mentality that has so contaminated america s inner cities the underlying cause of all this of course young black men growing up without fathers progressives of all colors have intimidated most white americans with the r word racist and now whites rarely comment on black criminality these same progressives are perpetuating the fatherlessness and anti police attitude that is wreaking havoc on america s inner cities many blacks today have a serious issue with authority figures this problem starts in the home and manifests itself as early as preschool a department of education study found that blacks make up 18 percent of all preschool children but they account for 42 percent of suspensions education secretary arne duncan blamed the problem on racial disparities and was stunned that we were suspending and expelling 4 years olds duncan is more stunned by the disciplinary action of the schools than he is by the rotten behavior of the kids no surprise rotten kids are anti authority so are progressives attorney general eric holder said a zero tolerance approach eventually leads many students into the criminal justice system and promised to end the school to prison pipeline in other words according to holder disciplining bad kids is creating a path to prison this is progressive wisdom jesse jackson al sharpton the naacp the congressional black caucus and other leftist black leaders have been excusing black criminals and stoking hatred toward police for decades the 1992 los angeles riots sparked by the police beating of rodney king resulted in the deaths of 60 people but rep maxine waters d calif didn t call it a riot she called it a

has skyrocketed according to compstat figures 129 people were shot last month a 43 percent increase over the same period last year in chicagoland progressive policies and fatherlessness have created

of staff and now mayor rahm emanuel is focused on the guns even though chicago has some of the nation s toughest gun control laws progressives have created an environment that rewards irresponsibility and dependency sending welfare payments to single women with children has resulted in the decline of black marriages today 73 percent of black kids are born out of wedlock since most black fathers are not around these children never develop respect for authority in fact they grow to hate the impatience and pressure their mothers put on them recently i interviewed paul raeburn author of do fathers matter here are just a few of his findings when fathers are absent during mother s pregnancy the baby is more likely to be born prematurely the baby is four times as likely to die in the first year if the man is depressed the child is eight times as likely to have behavior problems and 36 times as likely to have difficulty getting along with peers kids with dads around are less likely to become bullies oxford researchers said when fathers were absent children had higher rates of aggressive behavior obviously the missing link to end the cycle of violence and the anti police attitude in the black community is to rebuild black families progressive policies of providing financial incentives for single mothers who have kids out of wedlock must end progressives also bully people into not

message was that muslims were their friends neighbours and sports heroes in contrast trump is providing leadership he knows some of his grand standing is hot air but he is articulating a sentiment held by millions and reinforcing himself as a protector of the american people it s the reason trump is the republican front runner he has spent just 330 000 on broadcasting to jeb bush s 42 5 million which is indicative of how much america is enthralled by this new voice i hear cries that he is a blithering idiot i have often been called a deranged fool but if this were true you could ignore me

photo op with president john f kennedy in the rose garden hillary jumped into that dream by defining herself as financial provider so billy told dolly her support allowed him to pursue his addictions to politics power and sex bill s mother had supported the family financially while his stepfather drank now it was hillary supporting him and he introduced dolly to the woman from yale on the evening of may 28 1974 at the airport in little rock it was election night and senator william fulbright was running for re election he had been clinton s champion gave him his first senate job while bill

the sources said it was assembled in recent weeks russia has loomed large over the first six months of the trump presidency u s intelligence agencies have concluded that russia worked to tilt the presidential election in trump s favor mueller who was appointed special counsel in may is leading the probe which also examines potential collusion by the trump campaign with russia moscow denies any meddling and trump denies any collusion by his campaign while regularly denouncing the investigations as political witch hunts at a rally in huntington west virginia on thursday night trump said most people know there were no russians in our campaign we didn t win because of russia we won because of you mueller s use of a grand jury could give him expansive tools to pursue evidence including issuing subpoenas and compelling witnesses to testify the wall street journal earlier reported a grand jury was impaneled a spokesman for mueller declined comment a grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who working behind closed doors considers evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing that a prosecutor is investigating and decides whether charges should be brought this is a serious

unusual move u s stocks and the dollar weakened following the news while u s treasury securities gained it was not immediately clear to whom subpoenas were issued and the sources did not elaborate

opposition to the central government s takeover of the region following its unilateral declaration of independence from spain puigdemont whose regional government was dismissed by spanish prime minister mariano rajoy on friday accused madrid of premeditated aggression against the will of the catalans rajoy removed puigdemont took over the administration of the autonomous region and called a new election after catalonia s parliament declared itself an independent nation on friday the bold if to all appearances futile action marked a potentially dangerous escalation of spain s worst political crisis in the four decades since its return to democracy it s very clear that the best form of defending the gains made up until now is democratic opposition to article 155 puigdemont said in a brief statement he read out in the catalan city of girona referring to the legal trigger for the takeover but he was vague on precisely what steps the secessionists would take as the national authorities are already moving into barcelona and other parts of catalonia to enforce control spanish government spokesman inigo mendez de vigo said it would welcome puigdemont s participation in the regional elections it has called for dec 21 i m quite sure that if puigdemont takes part in these elections he can exercise this democratic opposition mendez de vigo told reuters tv in an interview european countries the united states and mexico have rejected the catalan declaration and expressed support for spain s unity puigdemont signed the statement as president of catalonia demonstrating he did not accept his ousting we continue persevering in the only attitude that can make us winners without violence without insults and also respecting the protests of the catalans who do not agree with what the parliamentary majority has decided he said the secessionists say a referendum on oct 1 gave them a mandate for independence however less than half of eligible voters turned out for the ballot which madrid declared illegal and tried to stop opinion polls show that more than half of the 5 3 million people eligible to vote in the wealthy northeastern region which is already autonomous do not want to break from spain but emotions are running high and the next few days will be tricky for madrid as it embarks on enforcing direct rule calling a new regional election is something of a gamble by prime minister mariano rajoy as it could increase the numbers of pro independence supporters in a new parliament but mendez de vigo said it would give catalans the final say about how they felt asked what would happen if puigdemont had to face prosecution mendez de vigo said judicial and political powers were separate in spain and that no one is above the law he did not comment further catalonia s police force told its officers to stay neutral a step towards averting possible conflict following doubts over how the mossos d esquadra as they are called would respond if ordered to evict puigdemont and his government the force is riven by distrust between those for and against independence and also estranged from spain s national police forces mossos and national officers have told reuters some catalan officers stood between national police and those trying to vote during the referendum given that there is it is likely to be an increase in gatherings and rallies of citizens and that there are people of different thoughts we must remember that it is our responsibility to guarantee the security of all and help these to take place without incident an internal memo said government buildings the headquarters of national political parties ports airports courts and the bank of spain were being guarded the interior ministry said units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary it said the madrid government also sacked the mossos chief josep lluis trapero who became a hero to the secessionists after his force took a much softer stance than national police in enforcing the referendum ban spain s high court barred trapero from leaving the country and seized his passport as part of an investigation for alleged sedition although it has

the unprecedented step of firing the catalonia government in a last resort to thwart the region s push for independence and to calm fears of unrest and economic turmoil in the heart of the euro zone catalan president carles puigdemont rejected madrid s decision to be implemented this week and thousands of pro independence protesters marched in barcelona on saturday the regional parliament s speaker carme forcadell said she too would not accept madrid s move and accused spanish prime minister mariano rajoy of staging a coup spanish foreign minister alfonso dastis responded on sunday with the call to obey madrid all the government is trying to do and reluctantly is to reinstate the legal order to restore the constitution but also the catalan rules and proceed from there dastis told bbc tv we are going to establish the authorities who are going to rule the day to day affairs of catalonia according to the catalan laws and norms i hope everyone will disregard whatever instructions they will be planning to give because they will not have the legal authority to do that however dastis sought to calm nerves in the region saying madrid would not conduct arrests among the pro independence leadership though two prominent secessionists were detained on court order this month on allegations of sedition we are not going to arrest anyone he said catalonia s leaders say they will not accept direct rule imposed by madrid raising the prospect that they and their supporters will seek to defy the spanish government when the time comes to remove them from office rajoy s use of special

the powers of the regional parliament for up to six months until fresh regional elections street protests for and against independence in catalonia have involved hundreds of thousands of people though a violent crackdown by national police during catalonia s oct 1 independence vote left hundreds injured according to regional authorities the protests have remained peaceful so far but rajoy s unprecedented plan to use special constitutional powers has angered both sides and raised concern over the potential for unrest if catalan leaders resist and call for civil disobedience they have not done that but investors are worried about the possible fallout from such moves in a region that makes up a fifth of spain s economy hundreds of companies have shifted their headquarters outside the

have made many i don t think the solution is to remove catalan autonomy he said as he walked in central barcelona with a friend i think they need to sit down and talk rajoy who acted with backing from king felipe and the main opposition party in madrid said the crisis was jeopardizing political and economic stability in the euro zone s fourth largest economy puigdemont who made a symbolic declaration of independence on oct 10 after the referendum called rajoy s move the worst attacks against the people of catalonia since spain s military dictatorship he stopped short of saying he would make good his threat to push ahead with a parliamentary vote on independence before direct rule takes effect but he has called the catalan parliament to meet next week to agree on a response to madrid something many observers said could pave the way for a formal declaration of independence the regional assembly is expected to decide on monday when it will hold a session several influential catalan newspapers called on puidgemont on sunday to resolve the crisis by calling a snap election before direct rule becomes effective however an opinion poll published by the el periodico newspaper on sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot in 2015 when a coalition of pro independence parties formed a minority government catalan government spokesman

his chance of becoming the nation s longest serving premier and re energizing his push to revise the pacifist constitution abe s liberal democratic party led ldp coalition won a combined 312 seats keeping its two thirds super majority in the 465 member lower house local media said a hefty win raises the likelihood that abe who took office in december 2012 will secure a third three year term as ldp leader next september and go on to become japan s longest serving premier it also means his abenomics growth strategy centered on the hyper easy monetary policy will likely continue final official results from the election which coincided with an approaching typhoon are expected early on monday the u s drafted constitution s article 9 if taken literally bans the maintenance of armed forces but japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self defense backers of abe s proposal to clarify the military s ambiguous status say it would codify the status quo critics fear it would allow an expanded role overseas for the military abe said he would not stick to a target he had floated of making the changes by 2020 first i want to deepen debate and have as many people as possible agree he told a tv broadcaster we should put priority on that the ldp s junior partner the komeito is cautious about changing the constitution drawn up after japan s defeat in world war two several opposition parties favor changes but do not necessarily agree on details amendments must be approved by two thirds of each chamber of parliament and then by a majority in a public referendum now that pro constitutional change parties occupy more than two thirds of the parliament the constitution will be the most important political issue next year said hidenori suezawa a financial market and fiscal analyst at smbc nikko securities and as we saw in the u k a referendum could be tricky so while abe is likely to be prime minister for the time being it is too early to say whether he can stay in power until 2021 abe declined to say if he would run for a third term abe had said he needed a new mandate to tackle a national crisis from north korea s missile and nuclear threats and a fast aging population and to approve his idea of diverting revenue from a planned sales tax hike to education and child care from public debt repayment reut rs 2yc0pma he called the poll amid confusion in the opposition camp and an uptick in his ratings dented earlier in the year by scandals over suspected cronyism and a perception he had grown arrogant after nearly five years in office abe has backed u s president donald trump s tough stance towards north korea which has test fired missiles over japan that all options including military action are on the table trump is to visit japan nov 5 7 to reaffirm the leaders tight ties abe s snap poll gamble had seemed risky some early forecasts saw the ldp losing a significant chunk of seats after tokyo governor yuriko koike often floated as possibly japan s first female premier launched her conservative party of hope that party absorbed a big chunk of the failed main opposition democratic party which abruptly decided to run no candidates of its own but voter enthusiasm soon waned despite its calls for popular policies such as an exit from nuclear power and a freeze on the planned sales tax rise koike did not run for a lower house seat herself she was in paris for a climate change event on sunday and failed to say whom her party would back for prime minister we had sought to put policies first but we ended up with a very tough outcome so i deeply apologize for that koike told nhk a new constitutional democratic party of japan cdpj formed by liberal former dp members got 54 seats beating the 49 seats of koike s party to become the biggest opposition group although both have just a fraction of the ldp s presence day by day we felt we were getting more voter support for our call to revive more decent politics and not fret about whether it s right or left wing said cdpj lawmaker tetsuro fukuyama several experts noted the ruling bloc s win was less a victory for the conservative long ruling ldp than a defeat for a divided opposition simply put this was the self destruction of the opposition said zentaro kamei a senior research fellow at think tank php institute and former ldp lawmaker shinjiro koizumi the ldp lawmaker son of popular former premier junichiro koizumi warned against ldp complacency it s not just that our party has become arrogant and complacent people are also getting increasingly fed up with us he told nhk abe 63 has already led the ldp and its partner the komeito to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party but turnout has been low and the ldp has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes others either stayed home or backed opposition parties kyodo news agency estimated turnout on sunday when heavy rain from powerful typhoon lan lashed much of japan

wrote the memo after president donald trump told him one day before the may 9 firing that he wanted to dismiss comey he said that though he was personally fond of comey i thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader the justice department on friday issued a transcript of rosenstein s remarks opening statement good afternoon i welcome the opportunity to discuss my role in the removal of fbi director james comey although i know you understand that i will not discuss the special counsel s ongoing investigation most importantly i want to emphasize my unshakeable commitment to protecting the integrity of every federal criminal investigation there never has been and never will be any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the united states department of justice before i discuss the events of the past two weeks i want to provide some background about my previous relationship with former director comey i have known jim comey since approximately 2002 in 2005 when mr comey was deputy attorney general he participated in selecting me to serve as a u s attorney as a federal prosecutor he was a role model his speeches about leadership and public service inspired me on july 5 2016 director comey held his press conference concerning the federal grand jury investigation of secretary clinton s emails at the start of the press conference the director stated that he had not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the department of justice they do not know what i am about to say director comey went on to declare that he would publicly disclose what we did what we found and what we are recommending to the department of justice he proceeded to disclose details about the evidence assert that the american people deserve to know details declare that no reasonable prosecutor would file charges and criticize secretary clinton i thought the july 5 press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the department of justice and secretary clinton it explicitly usurped the role of the attorney general the deputy attorney general and the entire department of justice it violated deeply engrained rules and traditions and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the fbi of interfering in the election there are lawful and appropriate mechanisms to deal with unusual circumstances in which public confidence in the rule of law may be jeopardized such mechanisms preserve the traditional balance of power between investigators and prosecutors and protect the rights of citizens director comey attended the maryland u s attorney s office training seminar on october 27 2016 and gave a detailed explanation of his reasons for making public statements about the conclusion of the secretary clinton email investigation i strongly disagreed with his analysis but i believe that he made his decisions in good faith the next day october 28 mr comey sent his letter to the congress announcing that the fbi was reopening the clinton email investigation he subsequently has said that he believed he was obligated to send the letter i completely disagree he again usurped the authority of the department of justice by sending the letter over the objection of the department of justice flouted rules and deeply engrained traditions and guaranteed that some people would accuse the fbi of interfering in the election before the senate judiciary committee on may 3 2017 director comey testified under oath about his public statements concerning the secretary clinton email investigation i strongly disagreed with his explanations particularly his assertion that maintaining confidentiality about criminal investigations constitutes concealment nonetheless i respected him personally former department of justice officials from both political parties have criticized director comey s decisions it was not just an isolated mistake the series of public statements about the email investigation in my opinion departed from the proper role of the fbi director and damaged public confidence in the bureau and the department in one of my first meetings with then senator jeff sessions last winter we discussed the need for new leadership at the fbi among the concerns that i recall were to restore the credibility of the fbi respect the established authority of the department of justice limit public statements and eliminate leaks on may 8 i learned that president trump intended to remove director comey and sought my advice and input notwithstanding my personal affection for director comey i thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader i wrote a brief memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my longstanding concerns about director comey s public statements concerning the secretary clinton email investigation i chose the issues to include in my memorandum before finalizing the memorandum on may 9 i asked a senior career attorney on my staff to review it that attorney is an ethics expert who has worked in the office of the deputy attorney general during multiple administrations he was familiar with the issues i informed the senior attorney that the president was going to remove director comey that i was writing a memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my own concerns and that i wanted to confirm that everything in my memorandum was accurate he concurred with the points raised in my memorandum i also asked several other career department attorneys to review the memorandum and provide edits my memorandum is not a legal brief these are not issues of law my memorandum is not a finding of official misconduct the inspector general will render his judgment about that issue in due course my memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for cause termination my memorandum is not a survey of fbi morale or performance my memorandum is not a press release it is a candid internal memorandum about the fbi director s public statements concerning a high profile

impeach widodo if he allowed the deficit to run past that limit david sumual chief economist at indonesia s bank central asia said a hike in electricity tariffs and slow disbursement of subsidies to

less well off the problem now is confidence in the prospect of the economy people don t want to spend sumual said in his state of the nation address last month widodo pledged to tackle income inequality by cutting red tape and making land acquisition easier to accelerate infrastructure projects and last week he urged his cabinet to focus on attracting investment to boost growth and create jobs but two officials who spoke to reuters said they worried he was not matching his rhetoric with bold steps that need to be taken now for growth to be marching higher next year when campaigning for the 2019 presidential election will begin on the to do list remains finding a way to rein in the overbearing dominance of state owned enterprises on the economy which was singled out by the world bank in july as something preventing private funds flowing in in addition there is a need to speed up efforts to tackle a tortuous regulatory and licensing regime to lift investment an area where widodo said last week during the launch of a new policy package there s so much we have to improve so much to fix just months ago widodo appeared to be fighting for his political survival as political opponents joined forces with radical islamist groups to foment popular fury over alleged blasphemous comments made by widodo s ally basuki tjahaja purnama the former christian governor of jakarta amid massive protests in central jakarta there were rumors of treason plots and even a military takeover beating the drum of indonesia s unity in diversity motto widodo embarked on a frenzy of public appearances at military barracks the homes of both political rivals and allies and at moderate islamic boarding schools all aimed at projecting an image of unity and control he has been busy in the past six to eight months fighting back against destabilizing forces said endy bayuni editor in chief of the most widely read english daily the jakarta post he s showed that he is very much in control of the situation and has become even more mature as a politician widodo s latest move to regain political authority took aim at hardline islamist groups by executive decree he banned hizb ut tahrir a group that calls for indonesia to be ruled by islamic sharia law saying its ambitions ran counter to the country s secular ideology such political dominance could provide widodo with a false sense of security the senior government official said the dark side of the story is the economy he said i think the biggest threat now potentially and it s the flip side of the incredibly strong political

president donald trump s supreme court nominee but republicans threatened to change the senate rules to ensure conservative judge neil gorsuch gets the lifetime job the senate judiciary committee voted 11 9 along party lines to send gorsuch s nomination to the full senate setting up a political showdown this week between trump s fellow republicans and the opposition democrats that appears likely to trigger a change in long standing senate rules to allow his confirmation democrats portraying gorsuch as so conservative he is outside the judicial mainstream have amassed 42 senators in support of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster requiring a super majority of 60 votes in the republican led 100 seat senate to allow a confirmation vote even before the panel voted committee member christopher coons put the democrats over the threshold as the 41st senator backing the filibuster bid graphic where senators stand on bid to block gorsuch vote tmsnrt rs 2ov6ko0 the senate s republican leaders insist gorsuch will be confirmed on the senate floor on friday regardless of what the democrats do republicans hold a 52 48 senate majority in the face of the filibuster senate majority leader mitch mcconnell would be expected to force a confirmation vote by having the senate change its rules and allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of supreme court justices a move sometimes called the nuclear option that trump favors senate democratic leader chuck schumer leading the filibuster effort said mcconnell should have the vision and courage to see past this impasse and not go nuclear suggesting that trump replace gorsuch with a new consensus nominee chosen after meeting with democrats senate confirmation of gorsuch 49 would restore the nine seat high court s conservative majority fulfilling one of trump s top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign trump in january nominated gorsuch a conservative appeals court judge from colorado he could be expected to serve for decades on the senate floor mcconnell called the democratic strategy a new low saying there was no principled reason to oppose a judge as well qualified and widely respected as gorsuch he did not explicitly say he would use the nuclear option but several republicans said that would happen white house spokesman sean spicer said the decision would be mcconnell s republican senator john mccain a long time opponent of senate rules changes told reporters he would support the move judiciary committee republicans blasted democrats for pursuing what they called the first partisan filibuster of a supreme court nominee there was a successful bipartisan filibuster five decades ago against a democratic president s nominee and said it would come to naught because of the threatened rule change but it was senate republicans who last year refused to even consider democratic former president barack obama s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to fill the same high court vacancy that trump has selected gorsuch to fill democrats including me are still furious at the way judge merrick garland was treated last year but the traditions and principles that have defined the senate are crumbling and we are poised to hasten that destruction this week coons said gorsuch was nominated to fill a vacancy created by the february 2016 death of conservative justice antonin scalia democrats have accused gorsuch of being insufficiently independent of trump evading questions on key supreme court rulings of the past including on abortion and political spending and favoring corporate interests over ordinary americans republicans control the white house and congress for the first time in a decade the inability of senate republicans to coax enough democratic support to avoid the nuclear option reflected the intense partisan divide in washington and the trump administration s failure to win the cooperation of the opposition party senators dianne feinstein the committee s top democrat and panel member patrick leahy along with fellow democrats mark warner and ben cardin also announced filibuster support on monday spicer accused democrats of partisan obstruction that sets a very dangerous precedent and told a briefing that we re obviously disappointed that the overwhelming majority of them are still playing politics with the nation s highest court the actual confirmation vote would be by a simple majority if the filibuster is stopped to date four democrats oppose a filibuster four short of the eight that republicans needed with the failure of republican healthcare legislation in congress and with courts blocking the president s ban on people from several muslim majority nations from entering the united states winning confirmation for gorsuch has taken on even more importance for trump the 60 vote super majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has over the decades forced the senate to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments republican committee member lindsey graham said if we have to we will change the rules and it looks like we re going to have to i hate that i really really do while gorsuch s opponents would fight a senate rule change it was the democrats who in 2013 changed the senate rules to limit filibusters after republicans used the procedure against obama s appeals court nominees the senate then led by democrats barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from supreme court justices even if republicans do change the rules legislation as opposed to appointments would still need to meet a 60 vote threshold',\n",
